| **[Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation for Document Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16470v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) faces dual challenges in processing lengthy multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and performing cross-modal reasoning. Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG) methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more robust multimodal DocVQA systems. Our benchmark and code are available at https://mmdocrag.github.io/MMDocRAG/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to NeurIPS 2025 DB</p></details> |
| **[Cognitive Edge Computing: A Comprehensive Survey on Optimizing Large Models and AI Agents for Pervasive Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03265v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article surveys Cognitive Edge Computing as a practical and methodical pathway for deploying reasoning-capable Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous AI agents on resource-constrained devices at the network edge. We present a unified, cognition-preserving framework spanning: (1) model optimization (quantization, sparsity, low-rank adaptation, distillation) aimed at retaining multi-step reasoning under tight memory/compute budgets; (2) system architecture (on-device inference, elastic offloading, cloud-edge collaboration) that trades off latency, energy, privacy, and capacity; and (3) adaptive intelligence (context compression, dynamic routing, federated personalization) that tailors computation to task difficulty and device constraints. We synthesize advances in efficient Transformer design, multimodal integration, hardware-aware compilation, privacy-preserving learning, and agentic tool use, and map them to edge-specific operating envelopes. We further outline a standardized evaluation protocol covering latency, throughput, energy per token, accuracy, robustness, privacy, and sustainability, with explicit measurement assumptions to enhance comparability. Remaining challenges include modality-aware reasoning benchmarks, transparent and reproducible energy reporting, edge-oriented safety/alignment evaluation, and multi-agent testbeds. We conclude with practitioner guidelines for cross-layer co-design of algorithms, runtime, and hardware to deliver reliable, efficient, and privacy-preserving cognitive capabilities on edge devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/EASI/</p></details> |
| **[FM4Com: Foundation Model for Scene-Adaptive Communication Strategy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05094v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks heralds an intelligent communication ecosystem driven by AI-native air interfaces. However, current physical-layer designs-typically following modular and isolated optimization paradigms-fail to achieve global end-to-end optimality due to neglected inter-module dependencies. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to communication tasks such as beam prediction and resource allocation, existing studies remain limited to single-task or single-modality scenarios and lack the ability to jointly reason over communication states and user intents for personalized strategy adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multimodal communication decision-making model based on reinforcement learning. The proposed model semantically aligns channel state information (CSI) and textual user instructions, enabling comprehensive understanding of both physical-layer conditions and communication intents. It then generates physically realizable, user-customized link construction strategies that dynamically adapt to changing environments and preference tendencies. A two-stage reinforcement learning framework is employed: the first stage expands the experience pool via heuristic exploration and behavior cloning to obtain a near-optimal initialization, while the second stage fine-tunes the model through multi-objective reinforcement learning considering bit error rate, throughput, and complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms conventional planning-based algorithms under challenging channel conditions, achieving robust, efficient, and personalized 6G link construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Multimodal Perception in Large Language Models Through Perceptual Strength Ratings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06980v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigated whether multimodal large language models can achieve human-like sensory grounding by examining their ability to capture perceptual strength ratings across sensory modalities. We explored how model characteristics (size, multimodal capabilities, architectural generation) influence grounding performance, distributional factor dependencies (word frequency, embeddings, feature distances), and human-model processing differences. We evaluated 21 models from four families (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Qwen) using 3,611 words from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms through correlation, distance metrics, and qualitative analysis. Results showed that larger (6 out of 8 comparisons), multimodal (5 of 7), and newer models (5 of 8) generally outperformed their smaller, text-based, and older counterparts. Top models achieved 85-90% accuracy and 0.58-0.65 correlations with human ratings, demonstrating substantial similarity. Moreover, distributional factors showed minimal impact, not exceeding human dependency levels. However, despite strong alignment, models were not identical to humans, as even top performers showed differences in distance and correlation measures, with qualitative analysis revealing processing patterns related to absent sensory grounding. Additionally, it remains questionable whether introducing multimodality resolves this grounding deficit. Although multimodality improved performance, it seems to provide similar information as massive text rather than qualitatively different data, as benefits occurred across unrelated sensory dimensions and massive text-only models achieved comparable results. Our findings demonstrate that while advanced LLMs can approximate human sensory-linguistic associations through statistical learning, they still differ from human embodied cognition in processing mechanisms, even with multimodal integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[MERaLiON-SER: Robust Speech Emotion Recognition Model for English and SEA Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04914v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MERaLiON-SER, a robust speech emotion recognition model de- signed for English and Southeast Asian languages. The model is trained using a hybrid objective combining weighted categorical cross-entropy and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) losses for joint discrete and dimensional emotion modelling. This dual approach enables the model to capture both the distinct categories of emotion (like happy or angry) and the fine-grained, such as arousal (intensity), valence (positivity/negativity), and dominance (sense of control), lead- ing to a more comprehensive and robust representation of human affect. Extensive evaluations across multilingual Singaporean languages (English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil ) and other public benchmarks show that MERaLiON-SER consistently surpasses both open-source speech encoders and large Audio-LLMs. These results underscore the importance of specialised speech-only models for accurate paralin- guistic understanding and cross-lingual generalisation. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides a foundation for integrating emotion-aware perception into future agentic audio systems, enabling more empathetic and contextually adaptive multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://huggingface.co/MERaLiON/MERaLiON-SER-v1</p></details> |
| **[SIMS-V: Simulated Instruction-Tuning for Spatial Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04668v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just 25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization, maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ellisbrown.github.io/sims-v</p></details> |
| **[DashCLIP: Leveraging multimodal models for generating semantic embeddings for DoorDash](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07110v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of vision-language models in various generative tasks, obtaining high-quality semantic representations for products and user intents is still challenging due to the inability of off-the-shelf models to capture nuanced relationships between the entities. In this paper, we introduce a joint training framework for product and user queries by aligning uni-modal and multi-modal encoders through contrastive learning on image-text data. Our novel approach trains a query encoder with an LLM-curated relevance dataset, eliminating the reliance on engagement history. These embeddings demonstrate strong generalization capabilities and improve performance across applications, including product categorization and relevance prediction. For personalized ads recommendation, a significant uplift in the click-through rate and conversion rate after the deployment further confirms the impact on key business metrics. We believe that the flexibility of our framework makes it a promising solution toward enriching the user experience across the e-commerce landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04601v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing, e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized, long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking with Video: Video Generation as a Promising Multimodal Reasoning Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04570v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1) Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration, we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks, Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU. Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model, positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |
| **[When Semantics Connect the Swarm: LLM-Driven Fuzzy Control for Cooperative Multi-Robot Underwater Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00783v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage remains challenging due to partial observability, limited communication, environmental uncertainty, and the lack of access to global localization. To address these issues, this paper presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact, human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic cognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

| **[Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting, separating observation from judgment. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Will Large Language Models Transform Clinical Prediction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18246v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Large language models (LLMs) are attracting increasing interest in healthcare. This commentary evaluates the potential of LLMs to improve clinical prediction models (CPMs) for diagnostic and prognostic tasks, with a focus on their ability to process longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data. Findings: LLMs show promise in handling multimodal and longitudinal EHR data and can support multi-outcome predictions for diverse health conditions. However, methodological, validation, infrastructural, and regulatory chal- lenges remain. These include inadequate methods for time-to-event modelling, poor calibration of predictions, limited external validation, and bias affecting underrepresented groups. High infrastructure costs and the absence of clear regulatory frameworks further prevent adoption. Implications: Further work and interdisciplinary collaboration are needed to support equitable and effective integra- tion into the clinical prediction. Developing temporally aware, fair, and explainable models should be a priority focus for transforming clinical prediction workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published: BMC Diagnostic and Prognostic Research</p></details> |
| **[Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TowerVision: Understanding and Improving Multilinguality in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21849v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+. TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research, we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, submitted to arXiv October 2025.

| **[Caption Injection for Optimization in Generative Search Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04080v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Search Engines (GSEs) leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multi-source information and provide users with accurate and comprehensive responses. Unlike traditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift users' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective perception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context, enhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video, producing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs. Existing G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and fail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption Injection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from images and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to enhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We systematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under both unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval metric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration in G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching LLMs to See and Guide: Context-Aware Real-Time Assistance in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00730v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) technologies in industrial training and on-the-job assistance has created new opportunities for intelligent, context-aware support systems. As workers perform complex tasks guided by AR and VR, these devices capture rich streams of multimodal data, including gaze, hand actions, and task progression, that can reveal user intent and task state in real time. Leveraging this information effectively remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a context-aware large language model (LLM) assistant that integrates diverse data modalities, such as hand actions, task steps, and dialogue history, into a unified framework for real-time question answering. To systematically study how context influences performance, we introduce an incremental prompting framework, where each model version receives progressively richer contextual inputs. Using the HoloAssist dataset, which records AR-guided task executions, we evaluate how each modality contributes to the assistant's effectiveness. Our experiments show that incorporating multimodal context significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of responses. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven multimodal integration to enable adaptive, intuitive assistance for AR and VR-based industrial training and assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is intended for submission to the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems for possible publication</p></details> |

This survey synthesizes the new frontier of alignment research by addressing critical gaps in multi-modal alignment, cultural fairness, and low-latency optimization. To systematically explore these domains, we first review foundational algo- rithms, including PPO, DPO, and GRPO, before presenting a detailed analysis of the latest innovations. By providing a comparative synthesis of these techniques and outlining open challenges, this work serves as an essential roadmap for researchers building more robust, efficient, and equitable AI systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[GDS Agent for Graph Algorithmic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20637v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We introduce new benchmarks that evaluate intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Revisiting Multimodal Positional Encoding in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23095v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding.

These outputs include architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object boxes with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods which exploit task-specific network designs, our model adheres to the standard multimodal LLM architecture and is fine-tuned directly from open-source LLMs. To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art performance in layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object detection. With that, we show a feasible path for enhancing the spatial understanding capabilities of modern LLMs for applications in augmented reality, embodied robotics, and more.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAMO: Fine-Grained Root Cause Analysis via Tool-Assisted LLM Agent with Multi-Modality Observation Data in Cloud-Native Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20462v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementing large language models (LLMs)-driven root cause analysis (RCA) in cloud-native systems has become a key topic of modern software operations and maintenance. However, existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: multi-modality input constraint, context window limitation, and dynamic dependence graph. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data for fine-grained RCA, namely TAMO, including multimodality alignment tool, root cause localization tool, and fault types classification tool. In detail, TAMO unifies multi-modal observation data into time-aligned representations for cross-modal feature consistency. Based on the unified representations, TAMO then invokes its specialized root cause localization tool and fault types classification tool for further identifying root cause and fault type underlying system context. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLMs in processing real-time raw observational data and dynamic service dependencies, guiding the model to generate repair strategies that align with system context through structured prompt design. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with comparable performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProMQA: Question Answering Dataset for Multimodal Procedural Activity Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22211v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal systems have great potential to assist humans in procedural activities, where people follow instructions to achieve their goals. Despite diverse application scenarios, systems are typically evaluated on traditional classification tasks, e.g., action recognition or temporal action segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel evaluation dataset, ProMQA, to measure system advancements in application-oriented scenarios. ProMQA consists of 401 multimodal procedural QA pairs on user recording of procedural activities, i.e., cooking, coupled with their corresponding instructions/recipes. For QA annotation, we take a cost-effective human-LLM collaborative approach, where the existing annotation is augmented with LLM-generated QA pairs that are later verified by humans. We then provide the benchmark results to set the baseline performance on ProMQA. Our experiment reveals a significant gap between human performance and that of current systems, including competitive proprietary multimodal models.

| **[Can Visual Input Be Compressed? A Visual Token Compression Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02650v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging, have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets, covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs (LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tutorial on Cognitive Biases in Agentic AI-Driven 6G Autonomous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19973v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The path to higher network autonomy in 6G lies beyond the mere optimization of key performance indicators (KPIs). While KPIs have enabled automation gains under TM Forum Levels 1--3, they remain numerical abstractions that act only as proxies for the real essence of communication networks: seamless connectivity, fairness, adaptability, and resilience. True autonomy requires perceiving and reasoning over the network environment as it is. Such progress can be achieved through \emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents perceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains, and act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals. However, deploying such agents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human design, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation. Between neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of well-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical formulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic components. The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored to each type of bias. The article finally provides two practical use-cases, which tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in 6G inter-slice and cross-domain management. In particular, anchor randomization, temporal decay and inflection bonus techniques are introduced to specifically address anchoring, temporal and confirmation biases. This avoids that agents stick to the initial high resource allocation proposal or decisions that are recent and/or confirming a prior hypothesis. By grounding decisions in a richer and fairer set of past experiences, the quality and bravery of the agentic agreements in the second use-case, for instance, are leading to $\times 5$ lower latency and around $40\%$ higher energy saving.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, 1 table, link to source code available</p></details> |
| **[Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MMGenSR Workshop (CIKM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Language-Enhanced Generative Modeling for PET Synthesis from MRI and Blood Biomarkers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02206v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566 participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns (Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78) outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79). Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DreamPRM: Domain-Reweighted Process Reward Model for Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20241v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage. However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |

Specifically, the framework transforms univariate and multivariate signals into tabular embeddings, which are then encoded into text and used to fine-tune the LLM. At inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the streamlined integration of time series with textual information.

Those systems rely inherently on generative and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). They extend SQL with semantic operators, configured by natural language instructions, that are evaluated via LLMs and enable users to perform various operations on multimodal data. Our benchmark introduces diversity across three key dimensions: scenarios, modalities, and operators. Included are scenarios ranging from movie review analysis to medical question-answering. Within these scenarios, we cover different data modalities, including images, audio, and text. Finally, the queries involve a diverse set of operators, including semantic filters, joins, mappings, ranking, and classification operators. We evaluated our benchmark on three academic systems (LOTUS, Palimpzest, and ThalamusDB) and one industrial system, Google BigQuery. Although these results reflect a snapshot of systems under continuous development, our study offers crucial insights into their current strengths and weaknesses, illuminating promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses the brittleness of traditional deep learning models in financial applications by: employing prompt-engineered LLMs to generate executable alpha factor candidates across diverse financial data, implementing multimodal agent-based evaluation that filters factors based on market status, predictive quality while maintaining category balance, and deploying dynamic weight optimization that adapts to market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the strategy in Chinese & US market regimes compared to established benchmarks. Our work extends LLMs capabilities to quantitative trading, providing a scalable architecture for financial signal extraction and portfolio construction. The overall framework significantly outperforms all benchmarks with 53.17% cumulative return on SSE50 (Jan 2023 to Jan 2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted performance and downside protection on the market.</p></details> |  |

Trained on a large-scale audio corpus, SeaLLMs-Audio exhibits strong performance across diverse audio-centric tasks, spanning fine-grained audio understanding and voice-based interaction. Its key features include: 1) Multilingual: the model primarily supports 5 languages, namely Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, English, and Chinese; 2) Multimodal: the model accepts flexible input modalities, including audio only, text only, as well as audio with text; 3) Multi-task: the model supports a wide range of tasks, including audio analysis tasks such as Audio Captioning, Automatic Speech Recognition, Speech-to-Text Translation, Speech Emotion Recognition, Speech Question Answering, and Speech Summarization. It also enables voice-based dialogue, including answering factual, mathematical, and general knowledge queries. As a significant step towards advancing audio LLMs in Southeast Asia, we expect SeaLLMs-Audio to benefit both the regional research community and industry. To automate LALM evaluation for Southeast Asia, we introduce SeaBench-Audio, a benchmark spanning multiple tasks. Experiments show that SeaLLMs-Audio achieves competitive performance compared with other LALMs on SEA languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Addressing the challenges of evolving, multimodal, and often ambiguous corporate messaging on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), we employ an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) to annotate a large corpus of corporate tweets on their topical alignment with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This approach avoids the need for costly, task-specific annotations and explores the potential of such models as ad-hoc annotators for social media data that can efficiently capture both explicit and implicit references to sustainability themes in a scalable manner. Complementing this textual analysis, we utilize vision-language models (VLMs), within a visual understanding framework that uses semantic clusters to uncover patterns in visual sustainability communication. This integrated approach reveals sectoral differences in SDG engagement, temporal trends, and associations between corporate messaging, environmental, social, governance (ESG) risks, and consumer engagement. Our methods-automatic label generation and semantic visual clustering-are broadly applicable to other domains and offer a flexible framework for large-scale social media analysis.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines three paradigms for building robotic systems: end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models that implicitly integrate perception and planning, and modular pipelines incorporating either vision-language models (VLMs) or multimodal large language models (LLMs). We evaluate these paradigms through two focused case studies: a complex instruction grounding task assessing fine-grained instruction understanding and cross-modal disambiguation, and an object manipulation task targeting skill transfer via VLA finetuning. Our experiments in zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal trade-offs in generalization and data efficiency. By exploring performance limits, we distill design implications for developing language-driven physical agents and outline emerging challenges and opportunities for FM-powered robotics in real-world conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 camera ready</p></details> |
| **[MotionGPT3: Human Motion as a Second Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24086v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), multimodal frameworks that unify understanding and generation have become promising, yet they face increasing complexity as the number of modalities and tasks grows. We observe that motion quantization introduces approximation errors that cap motion quality, and that unifying discrete text and continuous motion within a single-stream backbone amplifies cross-modal interference. Motivated by recent multi-branch Transformer designs that separate signals from different modalities, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal motion-language model for both understanding and generation. MotionGPT3 encodes raw motion into a continuous latent space using a variational autoencoder (VAE), thereby avoiding quantization-induced artifacts, while leveraging the semantic prior of pretrained language models. A dual-stream Transformer with shared attention preserves modality-specific routes while enabling controlled, bidirectional information flow, which reduces interference, stabilizing optimization, and empirically accelerates convergence without degrading fidelity. For multimodal joint training, a generate-then-align three-stage schedule further improves stability and limits cross-task interference. Experiments show that MotionGPT3 achieves 2x faster convergence in training loss and up to 4x faster convergence in validation, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on standard motion understanding and motion generation benchmarks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Learning to Steer: Input-dependent Steering for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12815v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://jayneelparekh.github.io/learn-to-steer/</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities. Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented 2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/umbertocappellazzo/Llama-AVSR</p></details> |

The performance of such models hinges on having a good connector that maps visual features generated by a vision encoder to a shared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity. Existing connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), lack inductive bias to constrain visual features within the linguistic structure of the LLM's embedding space, making them data-hungry and prone to cross-modal misalignment. In this work, we propose a novel vision-text alignment method, AlignVLM, that maps visual features to a weighted average of LLM text embeddings. Our approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to ensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can effectively interpret. AlignVLM is particularly effective for document understanding tasks, where visual and textual modalities are highly correlated. Our extensive experiments show that AlignVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods, with larger gains on document understanding tasks and under low-resource setups. We provide further analysis demonstrating its efficiency and robustness to noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[FESTA: Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment of Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16648v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions.

Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM. Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next, building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction and selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboOmni: Proactive Robot Manipulation in Omni-modal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23763v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reimagining Safety Alignment with An Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00509v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications but face dual challenges: generating harmful content under jailbreak attacks and over-refusal of benign queries due to rigid safety mechanisms. These issues are further complicated by the need to accommodate different value systems and precisely align with given safety preferences. Moreover, traditional methods like SFT and RLHF lack this capability due to their costly parameter tuning requirements and inability to support multiple value systems within a single model. These problems are more obvious in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in terms of heightened over-refusal in cross-modal tasks and new security risks arising from expanded attack surfaces. We propose Magic Image, an optimization-driven visual prompt framework that enhances security while reducing over-refusal. By optimizing image prompts using harmful/benign samples, our method enables a single model to adapt to different value systems and better align with given safety preferences without parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate improved safety-effectiveness balance across diverse datasets while preserving model performance, offering a practical solution for deployable MLLM safety alignment.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks. Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has transformed diabetes care, its potential for supporting sub-health populations -- such as individuals who are overweight, prediabetic, or anxious -- remains underexplored. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in health coaching, yet CGM is rarely incorporated as a first-class signal. To address this gap, we conducted a six-week autoethnography, combining CGM with multimodal indicators captured via common digital devices and a chatbot that offered personalized reflections and explanations of glucose fluctuations. Our findings show how CGM-led, data-first multimodal tracking, coupled with conversational support, shaped everyday practices of diet, activity, stress, and wellbeing. This work contributes to HCI by extending CGM research beyond clinical diabetes and demonstrating how LLM-driven agents can support preventive health and reflection in at-risk populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Human-Engaged Computing (ICHEC 2025), Singapore</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Item Scoring for Natural Language Recommendation via Gaussian Process Regression with LLM Relevance Judgments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22023v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Recommendation (NLRec) generates item suggestions based on the relevance between user-issued NL requests and NL item description passages. Existing NLRec approaches often use Dense Retrieval (DR) to compute item relevance scores from aggregation of inner products between user request embeddings and relevant passage embeddings. However, DR views the request as the sole relevance label, thus leading to a unimodal scoring function centered on the query embedding that is often a weak proxy for query relevance. To better capture the potential multimodal distribution of the relevance scoring function that may arise from complex NLRec data, we propose GPR-LLM that uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with LLM relevance judgments for a subset of candidate passages. Experiments on four NLRec datasets and two LLM backbones demonstrate that GPR-LLM with an RBF kernel, capable of modeling multimodal relevance scoring functions, consistently outperforms simpler unimodal kernels (dot product, cosine similarity), as well as baseline methods including DR, cross-encoder, and pointwise LLM-based relevance scoring by up to 65%. Overall, GPR-LLM provides an efficient and effective approach to NLRec within a minimal LLM labeling budget.</p></details> | 16 pages,20 figures |

In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data, small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, the scalability of these models is severely limited by the overwhelming volume of visual tokens generated from extended video sequences. To address this challenge, this paper proposes FLoC, an efficient visual token compression framework based on the facility location function, a principled approach that swiftly selects a compact yet highly representative and diverse subset of visual tokens within a predefined budget on the number of visual tokens. By integrating the lazy greedy algorithm, our method achieves remarkable efficiency gains by swiftly selecting a compact subset of tokens, drastically reducing the number of visual tokens while guaranteeing near-optimal performance. Notably, our approach is training-free, model-agnostic, and query-agnostic, providing a versatile solution that seamlessly integrates with diverse video-LLMs and existing workflows. Extensive evaluations on large-scale benchmarks, such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, demonstrate that our framework consistently surpasses recent compression techniques, highlighting not only its effectiveness and robustness in addressing the critical challenges of long video understanding, but also its efficiency in processing speed.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherently complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains, including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up to +6.69% across all datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal LLM-assisted Evolutionary Search for Programmatic Control Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05433v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive success in control tasks. However, its policies, represented as opaque neural networks, are often difficult for humans to understand, verify, and debug, which undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for programmatic control policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as programmatic policy generators, combining them with evolutionary search to automate policy generation. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and guide targeted improvements, thereby enhancing policy discovery efficiency and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results demonstrate that MLES achieves performance comparable to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two standard control tasks while providing transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This approach also overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various tasks, showing promise as a new paradigm for developing transparent and verifiable control policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergistic Tensor and Pipeline Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27257v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the machine learning system, the hybrid model parallelism combining tensor parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) has become the dominant solution for distributed training of Large Language Models~(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, TP introduces significant collective communication overheads, while PP suffers from synchronization inefficiencies such as pipeline bubbles. Existing works primarily address these challenges from isolated perspectives, focusing either on overlapping TP communication or on flexible PP scheduling to mitigate pipeline bubbles. In this paper, we propose a new synergistic tensor and pipeline parallelism schedule that simultaneously reduces both types of bubbles. Our proposed schedule decouples the forward and backward passes in PP into fine-grained computation units, which are then braided to form a composite computation sequence. This compositional structure enables near-complete elimination of TP-related bubbles. Building upon this structure, we further design the PP schedule to minimize PP bubbles. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves training throughput by up to 12% for LLMs and 16% for MLLMs compared to existing scheduling methods.

| **[Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work conducted in 2024; released for archival purposes</p></details> |

Although diagrams are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams, sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

Given this progress, we assess how well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity, and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process. We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows, and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) can integrate multimodal inputs to address heterogeneous data in complex urban systems but often underperform on domain-specific tasks. Urban-MAS, an LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework, is introduced for human-centered urban prediction under zero-shot settings. It includes three agent types: Predictive Factor Guidance Agents, which prioritize key predictive factors to guide knowledge extraction and enhance the effectiveness of compressed urban knowledge in LLMs; Reliable UrbanInfo Extraction Agents, which improve robustness by comparing multiple outputs, validating consistency, and re-extracting when conflicts occur; and Multi-UrbanInfo Inference Agents, which integrate extracted multi-source information across dimensions for prediction. Experiments on running-amount prediction and urban perception across Tokyo, Milan, and Seattle demonstrate that Urban-MAS substantially reduces errors compared to single-LLM baselines. Ablation studies indicate that Predictive Factor Guidance Agents are most critical for enhancing predictive performance, positioning Urban-MAS as a scalable paradigm for human-centered urban AI prediction.

In this work, we present Open3D-VQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to reason about complex spatial relationships from an aerial perspective. The benchmark comprises 73k QA pairs spanning 7 general spatial reasoning tasks, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer formats, and supports both visual and point cloud modalities. The questions are automatically generated from spatial relations extracted from both real-world and simulated aerial scenes. Evaluation on 13 popular MLLMs reveals that: 1) Models are generally better at answering questions about relative spatial relations than absolute distances, 2) 3D LLMs fail to demonstrate significant advantages over 2D LLMs, and 3) Fine-tuning solely on the simulated dataset can significantly improve the model's spatial reasoning performance in real-world scenarios.

However, current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks, and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for, compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS, which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the introduction of the audio modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard, the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM), which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new state of the art.

However, these efforts are still far from achieving a truly universal molecular model. We identify three key challenges in this endeavor: (1) Existing molecular task datasets are typically small in scale and lack comprehensive domain coverage. (2) Tasks from different molecular subfields are difficult to effectively learn jointly through LLMs due to significant distributional shifts and competition among tasks, which introduces instability in the learning process. (3) Both inter-task and intra-task molecular representations demand different intrinsic dimensions in the language space, making it challenging to balance between redundancy and insufficiency in language model representations. To address these challenges, we innovatively categorize existing small-molecule tasks into four types: Mol2Mol, Mol2Text, Mol2Num, and Text2Mol. We then collect a dataset encompassing over 16 tasks with more than 1.4 million samples, making it the largest molecular instruction-tuning dataset to date. Leveraging the extensive pretraining of LLMs on existing chemical literature, we propose a novel multimodal LLM framework, named Omni-Mol, which unifies all small-molecule tasks and supports both molecular generation and understanding. The core of Omni-Mol is our proposed MoGE, which dynamically adapts to the intrinsic rank of different tasks. This mixture-of-experts architecture enhances the model's ability to handle diverse tasks and modalities effectively. Our model achieves unified instruction tuning across 16 tasks and attains state-of-the-art performance on 13 of them.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2) insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%.

Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the LREC 2026 conference</p></details> |

There are three key features of WEST: 1) Fully LLM-based: Standing on the shoulders of giants by reusing mature architectures, ecosystems (e.g., Hugging Face), and methods (e.g., sequence packing) from large models. 2) Full-stack: Supports tasks such as recognition, synthesis, understanding, dialogue, and multimodal capabilities, with extensibility to incorporate open-source models. 3) Simple and Stupid: A simple and stupid speech toolkit that everyone can Touch. In addition, WEST provides two types of recipes, models, and experimental results. The first is entirely based on open-source models and open-source data, allowing users to fully reproduce the experiments in this paper and serving as a verification system or minimal system baseline. The second is trained on massive data, offering superior performance so the user can directly apply it out of the box.

Recent work leverages sentiment analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and multi-task learning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE EMBC 2025</p></details> |

We address this gap with TraveLLM, a system using Large Language Models (LLMs) for disruption-aware public transit routing. We leverage LLMs' reasoning capabilities to directly process multimodal user queries combining natural language requests (origin, destination, preferences, disruption info) with map data (e.g., subway, bus, bike-share). To evaluate this approach, we design challenging test scenarios reflecting real-world disruptions like weather events, emergencies, and dynamic service availability. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini, on generating accurate travel plans. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs, notably GPT-4, can effectively generate viable and context-aware navigation plans under these demanding conditions. These findings suggest a promising direction for using LLMs to build more flexible and intelligent navigation systems capable of handling dynamic disruptions and diverse user needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITSC 2025</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks fall short: they are largely single modality (text-only), span short time horizons, use shallow evidence, cover domains unevenly, and often omit full articles -- obscuring models' real-world capability. We present MMM-Fact, a large-scale benchmark of 125,449 fact-checked statements (1995--2025) across multiple domains, each paired with the full fact-check article and multimodal evidence (text, images, videos, tables) from four fact-checking sites and one news outlet. To reflect verification effort, each statement is tagged with a retrieval-difficulty tier -- Basic (1--5 sources), Intermediate (6--10), and Advanced (>10) -- supporting fairness-aware evaluation for multi-step, cross-modal reasoning. The dataset adopts a three-class veracity scheme (true/false/not enough information) and enables tasks in veracity prediction, explainable fact-checking, complex evidence aggregation, and longitudinal analysis. Baselines with mainstream LLMs show MMM-Fact is markedly harder than prior resources, with performance degrading as evidence complexity rises. MMM-Fact offers a realistic, scalable benchmark for transparent, reliable, multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Wenyan0110/MMM-Fact</p></details> |
| **[SeeingEye: Agentic Information Flow Unlocks Multimodal Reasoning In Text-only LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25092v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-only large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate remarkable reasoning ability. However, these models remain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks. Existing approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity and often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel for transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a modular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through an agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception agent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively distill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs) tailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM, which serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner engage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of targeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate that Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger end-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision translator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B VLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that decoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a scalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong text-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities.

Existing approaches often fail to unify structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting effective risk control.

It promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.</p></details> |  |

OMCRG captures natural dyadic interactions and introduces new challenges in aligning generated audio with listeners' facial responses. To tackle these challenges, we incorporate text as an intermediate modality to connect audio and facial responses. We propose OmniResponse, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that autoregressively generates accurate multimodal listener responses. OmniResponse leverages a pretrained LLM enhanced with two core components: Chrono-Text Markup, which precisely timestamps generated text tokens, and TempoVoice, a controllable online text-to-speech (TTS) module that outputs speech synchronized with facial responses. To advance OMCRG research, we offer ResponseNet, a dataset of 696 detailed dyadic interactions featuring synchronized split-screen videos, multichannel audio, transcripts, and annotated facial behaviors. Comprehensive evaluations on ResponseNet demonstrate that OmniResponse outperforms baseline models in terms of semantic speech content, audio-visual synchronization, and generation quality. Our dataset, code, and models are publicly available.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Dataset and Benchmark Track, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/Video-SafetyBench.github.io/</p></details> |

Investigating multimodal in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.</p></details> |  |

However, existing long-context benchmarks like Needle-in-a-Haystack primarily focus on unstructured text, neglecting the challenge of diverse structured tables. Meanwhile, previous tabular benchmarks mainly consider downstream tasks that require high-level reasoning abilities, and overlook models' underlying fine-grained perception of individual table cells, which is crucial for practical and robust LLM-based table applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{NeedleInATable} (NIAT), a new long-context tabular benchmark that treats each table cell as a ``needle'' and requires models to extract the target cell based on cell locations or lookup questions. Our comprehensive evaluation of various LLMs and multimodal LLMs reveals a substantial performance gap between popular downstream tabular tasks and the simpler NIAT task, suggesting that they may rely on dataset-specific correlations or shortcuts to obtain better benchmark results but lack truly robust long-context understanding towards structured tables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using synthesized NIAT training data can effectively improve performance on both NIAT task and downstream tabular tasks, which validates the importance of NIAT capability for LLMs' genuine table understanding ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing visual token pruning methods primarily focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called \textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches.

A challenging yet impactful frontier is the development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first, observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications (Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle</p></details> |

In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance.</p></details> | Under review |

However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,886 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, individual objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best-performing models, Google Gemini-2.5-Pro and OpenAI o3, achieve just around 30% accuracy on space-level tasks and around 40% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 176 publications across different application domains (e.g., healthcare, education, and entertainment). Using a four-dimensional coding framework (application, technical, evaluative, and ethical), we find (1) frequent use of pattern recognition and information extraction from multimodal sources, but limited support for adaptive, interactive reasoning; (2) a dominant 'modality-to-text' pipeline that privileges language over rich audiovisual cues, striping away nuanced social cues; (3) evaluation practices reliant on static benchmarks, with socially grounded, human-centered assessments rare; and (4) Ethical discussions focused mainly on legal and rights-related risks (e.g., privacy), leaving societal risks (e.g., deception) overlooked--or at best acknowledged but left unaddressed.

To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains, and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for advancing AI tutoring.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio, and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments.

SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including 2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software, and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent systems that reason about code. We believe that this dataset opens new opportunities for mining software behavior, improving security analytics, and enhancing LLM capabilities in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks for software code mining.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research on multilingual multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 tables and figures</p></details> |
| **[DeepOmni: Towards Seamless and Smart Speech Interaction with Adaptive Modality-Specific MoE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21864v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience. Code and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[MAP4TS: A Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework for Time-Series Forecasting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23090v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in long-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hierarchical Language Models for Semantic Navigation and Manipulation in an Aerial-Ground Robotic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05020v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous multirobot systems show great potential in complex tasks requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, existing methods that rely on static or task-specific models often lack generalizability across diverse tasks and dynamic environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical multimodal framework that integrates a prompted large language model (LLM) with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). At the system level, the LLM performs hierarchical task decomposition and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM provides semantic perception and object localization, where the proposed GridMask significantly enhances the VLM's spatial accuracy for reliable fine-grained manipulation. The aerial robot leverages this global map to generate semantic paths and guide the ground robot's local navigation and manipulation, ensuring robust coordination even in target-absent or ambiguous scenarios. We validate the framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments on long-horizon object arrangement tasks, demonstrating zero-shot adaptability, robust semantic navigation, and reliable manipulation in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first heterogeneous aerial-ground robotic system that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-driven reasoning for global high-level task planning and execution.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[PaperArena: An Evaluation Benchmark for Tool-Augmented Agentic Reasoning on Scientific Literature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10909v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78% average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%, highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage, often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code and data are available https://github.com/Melmaphother/PaperArena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

We present a unified, cognition-preserving framework spanning: (1) model optimization (quantization, sparsity, low-rank adaptation, distillation) aimed at retaining multi-step reasoning under tight memory/compute budgets; (2) system architecture (on-device inference, elastic offloading, cloud-edge collaboration) that trades off latency, energy, privacy, and capacity; and (3) adaptive intelligence (context compression, dynamic routing, federated personalization) that tailors computation to task difficulty and device constraints. We synthesize advances in efficient Transformer design, multimodal integration, hardware-aware compilation, privacy-preserving learning, and agentic tool use, and map them to edge-specific operating envelopes. We further outline a standardized evaluation protocol covering latency, throughput, energy per token, accuracy, robustness, privacy, and sustainability, with explicit measurement assumptions to enhance comparability. Remaining challenges include modality-aware reasoning benchmarks, transparent and reproducible energy reporting, edge-oriented safety/alignment evaluation, and multi-agent testbeds. We conclude with practitioner guidelines for cross-layer co-design of algorithms, runtime, and hardware to deliver reliable, efficient, and privacy-preserving cognitive capabilities on edge devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05636v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.</p></details> | 185 pages |

This survey synthesizes the new frontier of alignment research by addressing critical gaps in multi-modal alignment, cultural fairness, and low-latency optimization. To systematically explore these domains, we first review foundational algo- rithms, including PPO, DPO, and GRPO, before presenting a detailed analysis of the latest innovations. By providing a comparative synthesis of these techniques and outlining open challenges, this work serves as an essential roadmap for researchers building more robust, efficient, and equitable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Foundations for Deep Research Systems: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06733v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, second version</p></details> |

As AI-generated and AI-augmented music become increasingly mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may wonder: what research frontiers remain unexplored? This paper outlines several key areas within music AI research that present significant opportunities for further investigation. We begin by examining foundational representation models and highlight emerging efforts toward explainability and interpretability. We then discuss the evolution toward multimodal systems, provide an overview of the current landscape of music datasets and their limitations, and address the growing importance of model efficiency in both training and deployment. Next, we explore applied directions, focusing first on generative models. We review recent systems, their computational constraints, and persistent challenges related to evaluation and controllability. We then examine extensions of these generative approaches to multimodal settings and their integration into artists' workflows, including applications in music editing, captioning, production, transcription, source separation, performance, discovery, and education. Finally, we explore copyright implications of generative music and propose strategies to safeguard artist rights. While not exhaustive, this survey aims to illuminate promising research directions enabled by recent developments in music foundation models.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Spatial Reasoning in the Large Model Era: A Survey and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25760v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning.

However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation. Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis. Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.</p></details> | 22 pages,2 figures |

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-LMM Post-Training: A Deep Dive into Video Reasoning with Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05034v5)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 176 publications across different application domains (e.g., healthcare, education, and entertainment). Using a four-dimensional coding framework (application, technical, evaluative, and ethical), we find (1) frequent use of pattern recognition and information extraction from multimodal sources, but limited support for adaptive, interactive reasoning; (2) a dominant 'modality-to-text' pipeline that privileges language over rich audiovisual cues, striping away nuanced social cues; (3) evaluation practices reliant on static benchmarks, with socially grounded, human-centered assessments rare; and (4) Ethical discussions focused mainly on legal and rights-related risks (e.g., privacy), leaving societal risks (e.g., deception) overlooked--or at best acknowledged but left unaddressed. We outline a research agenda for evaluating socially competent, ethically informed, and interaction-aware multi-modal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability.

With powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks. Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping, agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides the first comprehensive treatment of long-document retrieval (LDR), consolidating methods, challenges, and applications across three major eras. We systematize the evolution from classical lexical and early neural models to modern pre-trained (PLM) and large language models (LLMs), covering key paradigms like passage aggregation, hierarchical encoding, efficient attention, and the latest LLM-driven re-ranking and retrieval techniques. Beyond the models, we review domain-specific applications, specialized evaluation resources, and outline critical open challenges such as efficiency trade-offs, multimodal alignment, and faithfulness. This survey aims to provide both a consolidated reference and a forward-looking agenda for advancing long-document retrieval in the era of foundation models.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

Despite rapid progress in acoustic modeling and deep learning, models still fall short of human expert performance. This manuscript provides a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind this gap, emphasizing a conceptual divergence we term the ``perceptual-statistical gap''. We detail human expert perceptual processes, survey machine learning representations and methods, review existing literature on feature sets and modeling strategies, and present a theoretical analysis of limits imposed by label noise and inter-rater variability. We further outline practical strategies to narrow the gap, perceptually motivated features, self-supervised pretraining, ASR-informed objectives, multimodal fusion, human-in-the-loop training, and explainability methods. Finally, we propose experimental protocols and evaluation metrics aligned with clinical goals to guide future research toward clinically reliable and interpretable dysarthria assessment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Literature Survey Automation with an Iterative Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21900v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention, yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting. This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads, and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys. To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written ones.

| **[Deep Insights into Cognitive Decline: A Survey of Leveraging Non-Intrusive Modalities with Deep Learning Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18972v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging. However, under some circumstances, this decline is more pronounced than expected, typically due to disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Early detection of an anomalous decline is crucial, as it can facilitate timely professional intervention. While medical data can help, it often involves invasive procedures. An alternative approach is to employ non-intrusive techniques such as speech or handwriting analysis, which do not disturb daily activities. This survey reviews the most relevant non-intrusive methodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitive decline detection task, including audio, text, and visual processing. We discuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology, including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture and foundation models. In addition, we present studies that integrate different modalities to develop multimodal models. We also highlight the most significant datasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. From this review, several conclusions emerge. In most cases, text-based approaches consistently outperform other modalities. Furthermore, combining various approaches from individual modalities into a multimodal model consistently enhances performance across nearly all scenarios.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion. We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure, normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify their limitations. Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions, including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.</p></details> |  |

Our survey reviews recent platforms that let users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration, output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type (chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration, and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs (customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 6th World Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Advances and Applications (WCAIAA 2025)</p></details> |

However, current researches in this area remain fragmented, and a comprehensive survey that systematically unifies existing efforts is still missing. To bridge this gap, our survey introduces a unified framework that systematically organizes the AI-GGC landscape. We present a novel taxonomy focused on three core commentator capabilities: Live Observation, Strategic Analysis, and Historical Recall. Commentary is further categorized into three functional types: Descriptive, Analytical, and Background. Building on this structure, we provide an in-depth review of state-of-the-art methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics across various game genres. Finally, we highlight key challenges such as real-time reasoning, multimodal integration, and evaluation bottlenecks, and outline promising directions for future research and system development in AI-GGC.</p></details> |  |

This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have predominantly focused on deepfake detection and often overlook recent advancements in synthetic image forensics, particularly approaches that incorporate multimodal frameworks, reasoning-based detection, and training-free methodologies. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of state-of-the-art techniques for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. The review systematically examines core detection paradigms, categorizes them into spatial-domain, frequency-domain, fingerprint-based, patch-based, training-free, and multimodal reasoning-based frameworks, and offers concise descriptions of their underlying principles. We further provide detailed comparative analyses of these methods on publicly available datasets to assess their generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the potential of hybrid frameworks that combine the efficiency of training-free approaches with the semantic reasoning of multimodal models to advance trustworthy and explainable synthetic image forensics.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 4 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Perception to Cognition: A Survey of Vision-Language Interactive Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25373v4)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound, human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information (Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.</p></details> |  |

We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation.

Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components.

We first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1 and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g., instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling to even larger contexts and improving robustness).

Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field.

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data and computational requirements associated with training video-language foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question answering).

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events.

Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.</p></details> | <details><summary>VLM/L...</summary><p>VLM/LLM Learning Notes</p></details> |

While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step.

| **[Deep Learning for Sports Video Event Detection: Tasks, Datasets, Methods, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03991v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video event detection has become a cornerstone of modern sports analytics, powering automated performance evaluation, content generation, and tactical decision-making. Recent advances in deep learning have driven progress in related tasks such as Temporal Action Localization (TAL), which detects extended action segments; Action Spotting (AS), which identifies a representative timestamp; and Precise Event Spotting (PES), which pinpoints the exact frame of an event. Although closely connected, their subtle differences often blur the boundaries between them, leading to confusion in both research and practical applications. Furthermore, prior surveys either address generic video event detection or broader sports video tasks, but largely overlook the unique temporal granularity and domain-specific challenges of event spotting. In addition, most existing sports video surveys focus on elite-level competitions while neglecting the wider community of everyday practitioners. This survey addresses these gaps by: (i) clearly delineating TAL, AS, and PES and their respective use cases; (ii) introducing a structured taxonomy of state of the art approaches including temporal modeling strategies, multimodal frameworks, and data-efficient pipelines tailored for AS and PES; and (iii) critically assessing benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols, highlighting limitations such as reliance on broadcast quality footage and metrics that over reward permissive multilabel predictions. By synthesizing current research and exposing open challenges, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for developing temporally precise, generalizable, and practically deployable sports event detection systems for both the research and industry communities.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[A Survey on Self-supervised Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Text-Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11101v5)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 8 figures, survey paper</p></details> |

This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams, we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality, highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e., perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method. Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IEEE ITSC 2025 and for publication in its Proceedings. \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[Generative AI for Cel-Animation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06250v4)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Celluloid (Cel) Animation production pipeline encompasses multiple essential steps, including storyboarding, layout design, keyframe animation, inbetweening, and colorization, which demand substantial manual effort, technical expertise, and significant time investment. These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist. Additionally, this paper explores future directions and advancements in AI-assisted animation.

Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language and multimodal tasks, this survey provides a detailed overview of recent advancements in video understanding that harness the power of LLMs (Vid-LLMs). The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisingly advanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general, temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge, suggesting a promising path for future video understanding. We examine the unique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing the approaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM, and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM. Furthermore, we identify five sub-types based on the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM as Text Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer. Furthermore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs. Additionally, it explores the expansive applications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkable scalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges. Finally, it summarizes the limitations of existing Vid-LLMs and outlines directions for future research.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising. This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories: Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal, and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors, conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the potential of foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Potentials of Foundation Models for Multimodal Alignment: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05184v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision, language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and highlight potential challenges.</p></details> |  |

We argue that the field is undergoing a paradigm shift, moving from simple recognition tasks that test "what" a model sees, to complex reasoning benchmarks that probe "why" and "how" it understands. This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks, where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey from the foundational "knowledge tests" of the ImageNet era to the "applied logic and comprehension" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey the current frontier of "expert-level integration" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench, SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself. Finally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative, and social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating truly intelligent systems.</p></details> |  |

This survey presents the first comprehensive, lifecycle-aligned taxonomy of data science agents, systematically analyzing and mapping forty-five systems onto the six stages of the end-to-end data science process: business understanding and data acquisition, exploratory analysis and visualization, feature engineering, model building and selection, interpretation and explanation, and deployment and monitoring. In addition to lifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design dimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool orchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and governance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis of agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and review emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies three key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization, and modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and monitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved challenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms. We conclude by outlining open challenges in alignment stability, explainability, governance, and robust evaluation frameworks, and propose future research directions to guide the development of robust, trustworthy, low-latency, transparent, and broadly accessible data science agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey paper; 45 data science agents; under review</p></details> |

While this area is still relatively young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits.

We reviewed 25 datasets published between 2008 and 2024, examining key factors such as dataset size, subject distribution, sensor configurations, annotation scales, and data formats for valence and arousal values. While camera-based datasets dominate the field, we also identified several widely used multimodal combinations.

This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based, shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets, computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the emerging research directions including multimodal integration and cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable, and clinically impactful solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive and Resource-efficient Agentic AI Systems for Mobile and Embedded Devices: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00078v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy, generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants, and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy, bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Large Language Models Meet Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24322v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged, integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science, multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning.

This survey systematically reviews four core research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception. Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models. Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Most existing models are trained on electronic health records (EHRs), which capture biological measures but rarely patient-clinician interactions. These relationships, central to care, unfold across voice, text, and video, yet remain absent from datasets. As a result, AI systems trained solely on EHRs risk perpetuating a narrow biomedical view of medicine and overlooking the lived exchanges that define clinical encounters. Our objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the feasibility of a longitudinal, multimodal system for capturing patient-clinician encounters, linking 360 degree video/audio recordings with surveys and EHR data to create a dataset for AI research. This single site study is in an academic outpatient endocrinology clinic at Mayo Clinic. Adult patients with in-person visits to participating clinicians are invited to enroll. Encounters are recorded with a 360 degree video camera. After each visit, patients complete a survey on empathy, satisfaction, pace, and treatment burden. Demographic and clinical data are extracted from the EHR. Feasibility is assessed using five endpoints: clinician consent, patient consent, recording success, survey completion, and data linkage across modalities. Recruitment began in January 2025. By August 2025, 35 of 36 eligible clinicians (97%) and 212 of 281 approached patients (75%) had consented. Of consented encounters, 162 (76%) had complete recordings and 204 (96%) completed the survey. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a replicable framework for capturing the multimodal dynamics of patient-clinician encounters. By detailing workflows, endpoints, and ethical safeguards, it provides a template for longitudinal datasets and lays the foundation for AI models that incorporate the complexity of care.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

A Comprehensive Survey on Responsible Generative AI for a Sustainable Future](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08650v5)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is moving rapidly from research into real world deployment across sectors, which elevates the need for responsible development, deployment, evaluation, and governance. To address this pressing challenge, in this study, we synthesize the landscape of responsible generative AI across methods, benchmarks, and policies, and connects governance expectations to concrete engineering practice. We follow a prespecified search and screening protocol focused on post-ChatGPT era with selective inclusion of foundational work for definitions, and we conduct a narrative and thematic synthesis. Three findings emerge; First, benchmark and practice coverage is dense for bias and toxicity but relatively sparse for privacy and provenance, deepfake and media integrity risk, and system level failure in tool using and agentic settings. Second, many evaluations remain static and task local, which limits evidence portability for audit and lifecycle assurance. Third, documentation and metric validity are inconsistent, which complicates comparison across releases and domains. We outline a research and practice agenda that prioritizes adaptive and multimodal evaluation, privacy and provenance testing, deepfake risk assessment, calibration and uncertainty reporting, versioned and documented artifacts, and continuous monitoring. Limitations include reliance on public artifacts and the focus period, which may under represent capabilities reported later. The survey offers a path to align development and evaluation with governance needs and to support safe, transparent, and accountable deployment across domains.

Fifty-six medical students & radiology trainees volunteered to annotate brain tumor MR images for the BraTS challenges of 2023 & 2024, guided by faculty-led didactics on neuropathology MRI. Among the 56 annotators, 14 select volunteers were then paired with neuroradiology faculty for guided one-on-one annotation sessions for BraTS 2025. Lectures on neuroanatomy, pathology & AI, journal clubs & data scientist-led workshops were organized online. Annotators & audience members completed surveys on their perceived knowledge before & after annotations & lectures respectively. Fourteen coordinators, each paired with a neuroradiologist, completed the data annotation process, averaging 1322.9+/-760.7 hours per dataset per pair and 1200 segmentations in total.

Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models.

| **[Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13759v5)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output control, and dynamic perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. A growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10$\times$ acceleration in inference speed. These developments position discrete diffusion models as a promising alternative to intelligence based on the traditional autoregressive approach.

| **[Empowering Time Series Analysis with Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02358v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across diverse real-world applications, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional approaches are largely task-specific, offering limited functionality and poor transferability. In recent years, foundation models have revolutionized NLP and CV with their remarkable cross-task transferability, zero-/few-shot learning capabilities, and multimodal integration capacity. This success has motivated increasing efforts to explore foundation models for addressing time series modeling challenges. Although some tutorials and surveys were published in the early stages of this field, the rapid pace of recent developments necessitates a more comprehensive and in-depth synthesis to cover the latest advances. Our survey aims to fill this gap by introducing a modality-aware, challenge-oriented perspective, which reveals how foundation models pre-trained on different modalities face distinct hurdles when adapted to time series tasks. Building on this perspective, we propose a taxonomy of existing works organized by pre-training modality (time series, language, and vision), analyze modality-specific challenges and categorize corresponding solutions, discussing their advantages and limitations. Beyond this, we review real-world applications to illustrate domain-specific advancements, provide open-source codes, and conclude with potential future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 fi...</summary><p>10 figures, 5 tables, 20 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Visual Grounding in Visual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10345v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension, answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos, caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we review representative works across the key areas of research on modern general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally, we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sanitization of Multimedia Content: A Survey of Techniques, Attacks, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02051v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploding rate of data publishing in our networked society has magnified the risk of sensitive information leakage and misuse, pushing the need to secure multimedia content from unintended exposure to potentially untrusted third parties. Data sanitization -- the process of securing multimedia by removing or obfuscating sensitive information such as personally identifiable or confidential data -- helps to mitigate the severe impact of security risks and privacy violations related to the published data. In this paper, we make several contributions. First, we classify data sanitization methods along two main dimensions: the media type (images, audio, text, and video) and the techniques used to sanitize sensitive regions, which we group into obfuscation-based (e.g., distortion, replacement) and removal-based approaches. Building on this categorization, we present a comprehensive review of technologies designed to protect multimedia content. We then broaden the scope by introducing the attacks that specifically target these technologies, followed by a discussion of potential countermeasures. Each aspect is complemented with critical discussions and lessons learned. Finally, we identify and elaborate on open research challenges in the crucial domain of multimodal multimedia sanitization. We argue that the systematization provided in this work -- together with the highlighted challenges and research directions -- offers a valuable blueprint for practitioners, industry, and academia alike, while paving the way for novel research avenues in the field.</p></details> |  |

As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

However, these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications, including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems. This comprehensive overview provides researchers and practitioners with insights into RAS methods, applications, and future directions.</p></details> | KDD'25 survey track |

| **[Large Foundation Models for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10570v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

Yet existing surveys largely classify models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span, hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing general-purpose video understanding.</p></details> | Research report |

World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (findings), camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[One Flight Over the Gap: A Survey from Perspective to Panoramic Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04444v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception, omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity, making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity. Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300 research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of panoramic vision technologies.

This survey reviews the rapidly growing literature on backdoor attacks and defenses in the computer-vision domain. We introduce a multi-dimensional taxonomy that organizes attacks and defenses by injection stage (dataset poisoning, model/parameter modification, inference-time injection), trigger type (patch, blended/frequency, semantic, transformation), labeling strategy (dirty-label vs. clean-label / feature-collision), representation stage (instance-specific, manifold/class-level, neuron/parameter hijacking, distributed encodings), and target task (classification, detection, segmentation, video, multimodal). For each axis we summarize representative methods, highlight evaluation practices, and discuss where defenses succeed or fail. For example, many classical sanitization and reverse-engineering tools are effective against reusable patch attacks but struggle with input-aware, sample-specific, or parameter-space backdoors and with transfer via compromised pre-trained encoders or hardware bit-flips. We synthesize trends, identify persistent gaps (supply-chain and hardware threats, certifiable defenses, cross-task benchmarks), and propose practical guidelines for threat-aware evaluation and layered defenses. This survey aims to orient researchers and practitioners to the current threat landscape and pressing research directions in secure computer vision.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which reveal whether a data point was used in training the target model, are an important technique for exposing or assessing privacy risks and have been shown to be effective across diverse machine learning algorithms. However, despite extensive studies on MIAs in classic models, there remains a lack of systematic surveys addressing their effectiveness and limitations in large-scale models. To address this gap, we provide the first comprehensive review of MIAs targeting LLMs and LMMs, analyzing attacks by model type, adversarial knowledge, and strategy. Unlike prior surveys, we further examine MIAs across multiple stages of the model pipeline, including pre-training, fine-tuning, alignment, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions for strengthening privacy resilience in large-scale models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception. Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges (e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of compositional visual reasoning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/pokerme7777/Compositional-Visual-Reasoning-Survey</p></details> |

Methods leveraging pretrained encoder-only models (e.g., BERT) and LLMs have outperformed many previous approaches, particularly excelling in zero-shot scenarios and complex reasoning tasks. This work surveys the evolution of model architectures in IR, focusing on two key aspects: backbone models for feature extraction and end-to-end system architectures for relevance estimation. The review intentionally separates architectural considerations from training methodologies to provide a focused analysis of structural innovations in IR systems. We trace the development from traditional term-based methods to modern neural approaches, particularly highlighting the impact of transformer-based models and subsequent large language models (LLMs). We conclude with a forward-looking discussion of emerging challenges and future directions, including architectural optimizations for performance and scalability, handling of multimodal, multilingual data, and adaptation to novel application domains such as autonomous search agents that is beyond traditional search paradigms.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional edge intelligence methods, characterized by static models and limited cognitive autonomy, fail to address the dynamic, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained scenarios inherent to emerging edge networks. Agentic artificial intelligence (Agentic AI) emerges as a transformative solution, enabling edge systems to autonomously perceive multimodal environments, reason contextually, and adapt proactively through continuous perception-reasoning-action loops. In this context, the agentification of edge intelligence serves as a key paradigm shift, where distributed entities evolve into autonomous agents capable of collaboration and continual adaptation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey dedicated to Agentic AI and agentification frameworks tailored explicitly for edge general intelligence. First, we systematically introduce foundational concepts and clarify distinctions from traditional edge intelligence paradigms. Second, we analyze important enabling technologies, including compact model compression, energy-aware computing strategies, robust connectivity frameworks, and advanced knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms.

| **[A Survey on the Safety and Security Threats of Computer-Using Agents: JARVIS or Ultron?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10924v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs. Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure Computer-Using Agents.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are fundamentally constrained by \emph{catastrophic forgetting}, \ie~a persistent challenge where models experience performance degradation on previously learned tasks when adapting to new tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative AI in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative AI models, encompassing large language models, multimodal large language models, vision-language-action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, thereby providing deeper insights into the field.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols. We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation, distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost. Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning, with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications. Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation, adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective and reliably aligned with human intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, the rapid proliferation of these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis, systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable, interpretable, and online actionable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journals</p></details> |

| **[Natural Language Generation from Visual Events: State-of-the-Art and Key Open Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13034v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, a substantial body of work in visually grounded natural language processing has focused on real-life multimodal scenarios such as describing content depicted in images or videos. However, comparatively less attention has been devoted to study the nature and degree of interaction between the different modalities in these scenarios. In this paper, we argue that any task dealing with natural language generation from sequences of images or frames is an instance of the broader, more general problem of modeling the intricate relationships between visual events unfolding over time and the features of the language used to interpret, describe, or narrate them. Therefore, solving these tasks requires models to be capable of identifying and managing such intricacies. We consider five seemingly different tasks, which we argue are compelling instances of this broader multimodal problem. Subsequently, we survey the modeling and evaluation approaches adopted for these tasks in recent years and examine the common set of challenges these tasks pose. Building on this perspective, we identify key open questions and propose several research directions for future investigation.</p></details> |  |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth (D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT), covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets, revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal categories when compared with RGB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first comprehensive survey for multi-modal visual object tracking; 6 multi-modal tasks; 338 references</p></details> |

| **[Uniworld-V2: Reinforce Image Editing with Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning and MLLM Implicit Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16888v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however, models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. \texttt{UniWorld-V2}, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available to support further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAIL-RL: Guiding MLLMs in When and How to Think via Dual-Reward RL Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02280v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward, which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Steer: Input-dependent Steering for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12815v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://jayneelparekh.github.io/learn-to-steer/</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning.

| **[Rethinking Facial Expression Recognition in the Era of Multimodal Large Language Models: Benchmark, Datasets, and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00389v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized numerous research fields, including computer vision and affective computing. As a pivotal challenge in this interdisciplinary domain, facial expression recognition (FER) has evolved from separate, domain-specific models to more unified approaches. One promising avenue to unify FER tasks is converting conventional FER datasets into visual question-answering (VQA) formats, enabling the direct application of powerful generalist MLLMs for inference. However, despite the success of cutting-edge MLLMs in various tasks, their performance on FER tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we provide FERBench, a systematic benchmark that incorporates 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs across four widely used FER datasets. Our results reveal that, while MLLMs exhibit good classification performance, they still face significant limitations in reasoning and interpretability. To this end, we introduce post-training strategies aimed at enhancing the facial expression reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, we curate two high-quality and large-scale datasets: UniFER-CoT-230K for cold-start initialization and UniFER-RLVR-360K for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), respectively. Building upon them, we develop a unified and interpretable FER foundation model termed UniFER-7B, which outperforms many open-sourced and closed-source generalist MLLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro and Qwen2.5-VL-72B).</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeEditor: Unified MLLM for Efficient Post-hoc T2I Safety Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24820v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable safety-utility balance.</p></details> |  |

This limitation has motivated a growing interest in unsupervised paradigms as a third stage of post-training after SFT and RL. While recent efforts have explored this direction, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. To address this, we propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs, enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. The training method of MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that such training method effectively improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3\%$\rightarrow$72.9\% on MathVista, 62.9\%$\rightarrow$68.7\% on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. To further explore scalability, we extend our framework to a data self-generation setting, designing two strategies that prompt the MLLM to synthesize new training samples on its own. Additional experiments show that combining these synthetic data with the unsupervised training method can also boost performance, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for autonomous enhancement of MLLMs, serving as a critical third step after initial SFT and RL in the absence of external supervision. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/MM-UPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shuffle-R1: Efficient RL framework for Multimodal Large Language Models via Data-centric Dynamic Shuffle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05612v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://xenozlh.github.io/Shuffle-R1/</p></details> |

However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective: simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone, consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity, geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Urban-R1: Reinforced MLLMs Mitigate Geospatial Biases for Urban General Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16555v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence (UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy urban intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[REALM: An MLLM-Agent Framework for Open World 3D Reasoning Segmentation and Editing on Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16410v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization, aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal, replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and versatility.

| **[RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16333v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at https://june-page.github.io/pivot/</p></details> |  |

Although recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>homep...</summary><p>homepage: https://rex-omni.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we first conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability. Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

Motivated by literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable reasoning skills, we propose a novel post-training method, Visual Game Learning (ViGaL), where MLLMs develop generalizable reasoning skills through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple games like Snake significantly enhances the downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, on multi-discipline questions like MMMU and on 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks like VSI-Bench, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models post-trained on benchmark-oriented multimodal reasoning data, while preserving the model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest that multimodal reasoning can emerge from gameplay, pointing to a promising strategy of designing surrogate tasks for RL post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunfeixie233.github.io/ViGaL/</p></details> |

By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results highlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more robust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) 2025</p></details> |

These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by conference EMNLP2025</p></details> |

Given that the vision modality typically contains more comprehensive information than the text modality, resulting in encoded representations comprising an extensive number of tokens, leading to significant computational overhead due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism. Current token reduction methods are typically restricted to specific model architectures and often necessitate extensive retraining or fine-tuning, restricting their applicability to many state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we introduce a learning-free token reduction (LFTR) method designed for MLLMs. LFTR can be seamlessly integrated into most open-source MLLM architectures without requiring additional fine-tuning. By capitalizing on the redundancy in visual representations, our approach effectively reduces tokens while preserving the general inference performance of MLLMs. We conduct experiments on multiple MLLM architectures (LLaVA, MiniGPT, QwenVL), and our results show that LFTR achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction of visual tokens while maintaining or even enhancing performance on mainstream vision question-answering benchmarks, all in a learning-free setting. Additionally, LFTR is complementary to other acceleration techniques, such as vision encoder compression and post-training quantization, further promoting the efficient deployment of MLLMs. Our project is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LFTR-AAAI-0528.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Jigsaw Post-Training Improves MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25190v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning. There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs. Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs.

| **[Scaling Synthetic Task Generation for Agents via Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25047v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information, which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover possible interactions and current state information to synthesize environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on human annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeRet: MLLMs as Training-Free Retrievers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24621v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing. On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Planning: Let's Think Only with Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11409v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations for these "vision-first" tasks, as a supplementary channel to language-based reasoning. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising supplement to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables (31 pages, 15 figures, 10 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[Sparsity Forcing: Reinforcing Token Sparsity of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18579v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead with minimal accuracy loss by selectively processing salient tokens. Despite their effectiveness, most methods merely exploit a model's inherent sparsity and thus plateau at moderate budgets (about 50\% token reduction), with little headroom to push budget lower without hurting accuracy. Other approaches attempt to enforce sparsity through trainable sparse attention or sharpness-inducing regularizers, but these either fix rigid patterns that ignore input and layer dynamics, or optimize proxy objectives without direct control over token budgets. In this paper, we explicitly reinforce token sparsity in well-posed multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through a simple RL-based post-training framework named \textit{Sparsity Forcing}. Our method explores the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by running multiple rollouts with different token budgets, where both efficiency (token reduction ratio) and performance (answer correctness) are formulated as joint rewards. By contrasting rollouts within each group, the more efficient and correct answer is rewarded while less efficient or incorrect ones are penalized, thereby turning token saving into an end-to-end, inference-consistent optimization objective. Across thirteen image and video benchmarks, Sparsity Forcing raises token reduction ratio on Qwen2-VL/Qwen2.5-VL from 20\% to 75\% with minimal accuracy decline, significantly reducing long-context inference memory by up to 3$\times$ while speeding up decoding by up to 3.3$\times$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Visual Understanding in Multimodal Reasoning through a Lens of Image Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09736v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup, and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

Although recent innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO, a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN, Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Enables MLLMs Preserve Prior Knowledge Better: A Data Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23508v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.</p></details> | 20 pages (Preprint.) |

However, we observe that directly tuning the Instruct (i.e., instruction-tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even performance degeneration. Notably, paired Base models, the foundation for these Instruct variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on average for Llama 3.1 8B). The Base model tends to be a good learner yet a weak backbone without post-training. Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to tune the Instruct models by leveraging the corresponding Base models. The key insight is to fine-tune the Base model, and then \textit{directly} graft the learned weight updates to the Instruct model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with direct preference optimization~(DPO).

Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turning Internal Gap into Self-Improvement: Promoting the Generation-Understanding Unification in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16663v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although unified MLLMs aim to unify generation and understanding, they are considered to exhibit an internal gap, with understanding outperforming generation. Through large-scale evaluation across multiple MLLMs and tasks, we confirm the widespread non-unification of MLLMs, and demonstrate that it indeed stems from weak generation rather than misunderstanding. This finding motivates us to propose a simple yet effective internal gap-based self-improvement framework, which mitigates internal gaps by leveraging stronger understanding to guide weaker generation without relying on any external signals. We validate this strategy through comprehensive experiments: scoring generations with understanding to construct image data for post-training (e.g., SFT and DPO) significantly improves generation while promoting unification. Furthermore, we empirically discover a co-improvement effect of such self-improvement, a phenomenon well known in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Specifically, as generation improves, understanding becomes more effective at detecting false positives that were previously misclassified as prompt-aligned. To explain this effect, we extend learning dynamic theory to the MLLM setting, showing that the shared empirical neural tangent kernel between generation and understanding encourages aligned learning dynamics, thereby driving co-improvement. This interplay between generation and understanding further motivates a curriculum learning approach for stronger self-improvement: progressively enhanced understanding and generation revisit samples underutilized by pre-trained MLLMs, dynamically expanding post-training data and leading to improved performance and unification.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 16 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[ActiveVLN: Towards Active Exploration via Multi-Turn RL in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12618v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments. Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (findings), camera-ready version</p></details> |

However, video understanding remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5, which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity, processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution (Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment, incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github page: https://github.com/Kwai-Keye/Keye</p></details> |

To push their reasoning ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy, they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions, establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Trustworthy FMs workshop in ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[DMGIN: How Multimodal LLMs Enhance Large Recommendation Models for Lifelong User Post-click Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21801v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps, DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On Domain-Adaptive Post-Training for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19930v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Findings, Project Page: https://huggingface.co/AdaptLLM/Adapt-MLLM-to-Domains</p></details> |

However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2) Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER) based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance. Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2 Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research community advancements.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6figures |
| **[Debiasing Multimodal Large Language Models via Penalization of Language Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05262v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in generating textual responses based on visual inputs. Despite their advancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias: the generated content is often driven more by the inherent priors of the underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) than by the input image. Empirical experiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as MLLMs often provide confident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent visual inputs. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward visual information, we propose two simple, training-free strategies. First, for tasks such as classification or multi-choice question answering, we introduce a "Post-Hoc Debias" method using an affine calibration step to adjust the output distribution. This approach ensures uniform answer scores when the image is absent, acting as an effective regularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more intricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to "Visual Debias Decoding", which mitigates bias by contrasting token log-probabilities conditioned on a correct image versus a meaningless one. Additionally, our investigation sheds light on the instability of MLLMs across various decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different settings, we achieve significant performance improvements--surpassing previously reported results--and raise concerns about the fairness of current evaluation practices. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in mitigating biases. These strategies not only prove beneficial in minimizing hallucinations but also contribute to the generation of more helpful and precise illustrations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

However, the absence of rigorous and systematic benchmarks has hindered progress in this area. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MLLM-CTBench}, a dataset curating seven challenging tasks from six diverse domains with three contributions. First,to enable fine-grained analysis of continual learning ability, we introduce \textbf{multidimensional evaluation metrics}, which combines final answer accuracy with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning quality assessment through a carefully trained MLLM evaluator. Then, we conduct a \textbf{comprehensive evaluation of continual learning algorithms}, systematically assessing eight algorithms from four major categories to provide actionable insights for algorithm design and adoption. Finally ,we evaluate the efficacy of \textbf{Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) versus Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)} in maintaining model performance across sequential tasks during continual instruction tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that reasoning processes in MLLMs exhibit greater resilience than final outputs to forgetting during continual learning, aligning with cognitive theories of hierarchical forgetting. We further show that both model capability and task sequence significantly influence continual learning outcomes, with stronger baseline models exhibiting greater resistance to forgetting. Notably, properly regularized RFT emerges as a more robust approach than SFT for maintaining performance across tasks.One of the key contributing factors is KL-divergence regularization, without which RFT leads to even worse forgetting than SFT on old tasks though may perform better on new tasks.</p></details> | under review |
| **[MME-Emotion: A Holistic Evaluation Benchmark for Emotional Intelligence in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09210v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress, current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and \textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$ recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark. \ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion, we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional intelligence in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[MQuant: Unleashing the Inference Potential of Multimodal Large Language Models via Full Static Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00425v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their ability to understand multimodal input. However, their large parameter sizes and substantial computational demands severely hinder their practical deployment and application.While quantization is an effective way to reduce model size and inference latency, its application to MLLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Conventional quantization often struggles with MLLMs because of (a) high inference latency from large visual token counts, (b) distributional disparities between visual and textual tokens, and (c) extreme outliers introduced by Hadamard-based transformations. To address these issues, MQuant introduces: Modality-Specific Static Quantization (MSQ), assigning distinct static scales for visual vs. textual tokens; Attention-Invariant Flexible Switching (AIFS), reordering tokens to preserve casual attention while eliminating expensive token-wise scale computations; Rotation Magnitude Suppression (RMS), mitigating weight outliers arising from online Hadamard rotations. On five mainstream MLLMs (including Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, CogVLM2), MQuant under W4A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (<1% degradation) while reducing inference latency by up to 30%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ baselines. Our MQuant effectively bridges the gap for efficient and accurate MLLMs inference in resource-constrained devices. Code has been released in https://github.com/StiphyJay/MQuant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025.

However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on ScreenSpotV2.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Reasoning of Multi-Image Grounding in MLLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00748v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance degrades when handling real-world applications that involve complex multi-image compositions and multi-modal instructions, revealing limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the reasoning of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, yielding improvements of +9.04% on MIG-Bench, +6.37% on MC-Bench, and +4.98% on several out-of-domain reasoning grounding benchmarks compared to the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1% and +2.4% over the base model on BLINK and MMIU benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Introspection of Thought Helps AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08664v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end, we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought (INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt. Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM, which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified, with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines. Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification experiments.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose LaCo (Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations, and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while maintaining strong performance.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an 8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment, followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report: https://github.com/Kwai-Keye/Keye</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment. Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment. Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the VDCSCORE evaluation metric.</p></details> |  |

To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1, we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9% consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision. GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model) against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1, achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and robust MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code released at: https://github.com/TencentARC/GRPO-CARE</p></details> |

A First Step Toward Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs via Self-Improving Systematic Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v6)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) has shifted focus from pre-training to inference-time computation and post-training optimization, largely due to concerns over the availability of high-quality human data. However, these strategies alone are insufficient to drive substantial model improvements. We argue that effective model advancement requires strong synergy among pre-training, inference-time computation, and post-training optimization. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework for constructing next-generation foundation MLLMs by imparting multimodal knowledge and enhancing systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description for step-by-step visual understanding and integrate structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to support in-depth multimodal reasoning. SIcog first equips a base model with systematic perception and reasoning using minimal external supervision. The enhanced models then generate candidate image captions and CoT reasoning responses for unlabeled images and image-question pairs across diverse tasks, which are filtered through a semantic-similarity-guided self-consistency mechanism. These high-quality, self-generated samples enable large-scale multimodal pre-training, creating a self-improvement loop. Experiments demonstrate SIcog's effectiveness in developing MLLMs with enhanced multimodal cognition. Using only 213K self-generated pre-training samples, SIcog achieves significant improvements, including +3.6% on MMStar and +3.5% on AI2D, outperforming previous pre-training approaches. When combined with post-training techniques for CoT reasoning, SIcog yields +9% gains on MMVet and +8.5% on ScienceQA.</p></details> | 43 pages. Preprint |

Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://modomodo-rl.github.io/</p></details> |

Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in vision-language tasks, while reinforcement learning tuning (RLT) has further improved their reasoning abilities. In this work, we explore RLT as a post-training strategy to enhance the video-specific reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Built upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, we propose a dual-reward formulation that supervises both semantic and temporal reasoning through discrete and continuous reward signals. To facilitate effective preference-based optimization, we introduce a variance-aware data selection strategy based on repeated inference to identify samples that provide informative learning signals. We evaluate our approach across eight representative video understanding tasks, including VideoQA, Temporal Video Grounding, and Grounded VideoQA. Our method consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing RLT baselines, achieving superior performance with significantly less training data. These results underscore the importance of reward design and data selection in advancing reasoning-centric video understanding with MLLMs. Notably, The initial code release (two months ago) has now been expanded with updates, including optimized reward mechanisms and additional datasets.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation of GRPO-based RL post-training for video MLLMs, with the goal of enhancing video MLLMs' capability of describing actions in videos. Specifically, we develop the VideoCap-R1, which is prompted to first perform structured thinking that analyzes video subjects with their attributes and actions before generating complete captions, supported by two specialized reward mechanisms: a LLM-free think scorer evaluating the structured thinking quality and a LLM-assisted caption scorer assessing the output quality. The RL training framework effectively establishes the connection between structured reasoning and comprehensive description generation, enabling the model to produce captions with more accurate actions. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoCap-R1 achieves substantial improvements over the Qwen2VL-7B baseline using limited samples (1.5k) across multiple video caption benchmarks (DREAM1K: +4.4 event F1, VDC: +4.2 Acc, CAREBENCH: +3.1 action F1, +6.9 object F1) while consistently outperforming the SFT-trained counterparts, confirming GRPO's superiority in enhancing MLLMs' captioning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing is Not Reasoning: MVPBench for Graph-based Evaluation of Multi-path Visual Physical CoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24182v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physical world - governed by laws of motion, spatial relations, and causality - poses a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent advances such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-4o demonstrate impressive perceptual and reasoning capabilities, our investigation reveals these models struggle profoundly with visual physical reasoning, failing to grasp basic physical laws, spatial interactions, and causal effects in complex scenes. More importantly, they often fail to follow coherent reasoning chains grounded in visual evidence, especially when multiple steps are needed to arrive at the correct answer. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we introduce MVPBench, a curated benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate visual physical reasoning through the lens of visual chain-of-thought (CoT). Each example features interleaved multi-image inputs and demands not only the correct final answer but also a coherent, step-by-step reasoning path grounded in evolving visual cues. This setup mirrors how humans reason through real-world physical processes over time. To ensure fine-grained evaluation, we introduce a graph-based CoT consistency metric that verifies whether the reasoning path of model adheres to valid physical logic. Additionally, we minimize shortcut exploitation from text priors, encouraging models to rely on visual understanding. Experimental results reveal a concerning trend: even cutting-edge MLLMs exhibit poor visual reasoning accuracy and weak image-text alignment in physical domains. Surprisingly, RL-based post-training alignment - commonly believed to improve visual reasoning performance - often harms spatial reasoning, suggesting a need to rethink current fine-tuning practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed-R1: Unified Reward Perspective For Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24164v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Although recent efforts leverage group relative policy optimization (GRPO) for MLLMs post-training, they constantly explore one specific aspect, such as grounding tasks, math problems, or chart analysis. There are no works that can leverage multi-source MLLM tasks for stable reinforcement learning. In this work, we present a unified perspective to solve this problem. We present Mixed-R1, a unified yet straightforward framework that contains a mixed reward function design (Mixed-Reward) and a mixed post-training dataset (Mixed-45K). We first design a data engine to select high-quality examples to build the Mixed-45K post-training dataset. Then, we present a Mixed-Reward design, which contains various reward functions for various MLLM tasks. In particular, it has four different reward functions: matching reward for binary answer or multiple-choice problems, chart reward for chart-aware datasets, IoU reward for grounding problems, and open-ended reward for long-form text responses such as caption datasets. To handle the various long-form text content, we propose a new open-ended reward named Bidirectional Max-Average Similarity (BMAS) by leveraging tokenizer embedding matching between the generated response and the ground truth. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method on various MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL and Intern-VL on various sizes. Our dataset and model are available at https://github.com/xushilin1/mixed-r1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Threading Keyframe with Narratives: MLLMs as Strong Long Video Comprehenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24158v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Employing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for long video understanding remains a challenging problem due to the dilemma between the substantial number of video frames (i.e., visual tokens) versus the limited context length of language models. Traditional uniform sampling often leads to selection of irrelevant content, while post-training MLLMs on thousands of frames imposes a substantial computational burden. In this paper, we propose threading keyframes with narratives (Nar-KFC), a plug-and-play module to facilitate effective and efficient long video perception. Nar-KFC generally involves two collaborative steps. First, we formulate the keyframe selection process as an integer quadratic programming problem, jointly optimizing query-relevance and frame-diversity. To avoid its computational complexity, a customized greedy search strategy is designed as an efficient alternative. Second, to mitigate the temporal discontinuity caused by sparse keyframe sampling, we further introduce interleaved textual narratives generated from non-keyframes using off-the-shelf captioners. These narratives are inserted between keyframes based on their true temporal order, forming a coherent and compact representation. Nar-KFC thus serves as a temporal- and content-aware compression strategy that complements visual and textual modalities. Experimental results on multiple long-video benchmarks demonstrate that Nar-KFC significantly improves the performance of popular MLLMs. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-Holmes: Can MLLM Think Like Holmes for Complex Video Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21374v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in CoT reasoning and RL post-training have been reported to enhance video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This progress naturally raises a question: can these models perform complex video reasoning in a manner comparable to human experts? However, existing video benchmarks primarily evaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be answered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must actively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a conclusion. To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark inspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Video-Holmes consists of 1,837 questions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans seven carefully designed tasks. Each task is constructed by first identifying key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions that require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual clues scattered across different video segments. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at visual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating information and often miss critical clues. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves an accuracy of only 45%, with most models scoring below 40%. We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a "Holmes-test" for multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field. The benchmark is released in https://github.com/TencentARC/Video-Holmes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://github.com/TencentARC/Video-Holmes</p></details> |

However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.</p></details> |  |

They have since covered extensive areas of traditional learning tasks. For instance, text-based tasks such as text-classification and sequence-labeling, as well as multi-modal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which were previously addressed using different models, can now be tackled based on one foundation model. Consequently, the training and lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs and MLLMs, especially those based on Transformer architecture, has become particularly important. In recognition of these overwhelming needs, we develop SWIFT, a customizable one-stop infrastructure for large models. With support of over $300+$ LLMs and $50+$ MLLMs, SWIFT stands as the open-source framework that provide the most comprehensive support for fine-tuning large models. In particular, it is the first training framework that provides systematic support for MLLMs. In addition to the core functionalities of fine-tuning, SWIFT also integrates post-training processes such as inference, evaluation, and model quantization, to facilitate fast adoptions of large models in various application scenarios. With a systematic integration of various training techniques, SWIFT offers helpful utilities such as benchmark comparisons among different training techniques for large models. For fine-tuning models specialized in agent framework, we show that notable improvements on the ToolBench leader-board can be achieved by training with customized dataset on SWIFT, with an increase of 5.2%-21.8% in the Act.EM metric over various baseline models, a reduction in hallucination by 1.6%-14.1%, and an average performance improvement of 8%-17%.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAMP: Token-Adaptive Layerwise Pruning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09897v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in understanding diverse multimodal data and tasks. However, these capabilities come with an increased model scale. While post-training pruning reduces model size in unimodal models, its application to MLLMs often yields limited success. Our analysis discovers that conventional methods fail to account for the unique token attributes across layers and modalities inherent to MLLMs. Inspired by this observation, we propose TAMP, a simple yet effective pruning framework tailored for MLLMs, featuring two key components: (1) Diversity-Aware Sparsity, which adjusts sparsity ratio per layer based on diversities among multimodal output tokens, preserving more parameters in high-diversity layers; and (2) Adaptive Multimodal Input Activation, which identifies representative multimodal input tokens using attention scores to guide unstructured weight pruning. We validate our method on two state-of-the-art MLLMs: LLaVA-NeXT, designed for vision-language tasks, and VideoLLaMA2, capable of processing audio, visual, and language modalities. Empirical experiments across various multimodal evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that each component of our approach substantially outperforms existing pruning techniques.</p></details> | ACL Findings 2025 |

Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives.

This risk is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge through multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how effectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning) necessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs. While prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal unlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as an attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific multimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset using an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for testing generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for maintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven attacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method leveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal attacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective defense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally, larger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale enhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing unlearning in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Vaidehi99/UnLOK-VQA</p></details> |

These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.</p></details> | Technical Report |

While promising, our initial experiments reveal that incorporating a thinking process through RL does not consistently lead to performance gains across all visual perception tasks. This leads us to delve into the essential role of RL in the context of visual perception. In this work, we return to the fundamentals and explore the effects of RL on different perception tasks. We observe that the perceptual complexity is a major factor in determining the effectiveness of RL. We also observe that reward design plays a crucial role in further approching the upper limit of model perception. To leverage these findings, we propose Perception-R1, a scalable RL framework using GRPO during MLLM post-training. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Perception-R1 achieves +4.2% on RefCOCO+, +17.9% on PixMo-Count, +4.2% on PageOCR, and notably, 31.9% AP on COCO2017 val for the first time, establishing a strong baseline for perception policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github page: https://github.com/linkangheng/PR1</p></details> |

During the exploration of MLLM training, we identified Modality Composition Incoherence, a phenomenon that the proportion of a certain modality varies dramatically across different examples. It exacerbates the challenges of addressing mini-batch imbalances, which lead to uneven GPU utilization between Data Parallel (DP) instances and severely degrades the efficiency and scalability of MLLM training, ultimately affecting training speed and hindering further research on MLLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce OrchMLLM, a comprehensive framework designed to mitigate the inefficiencies in MLLM training caused by Modality Composition Incoherence. First, we propose Batch Post-Balancing Dispatcher, a technique that efficiently eliminates mini-batch imbalances in sequential data. Additionally, we integrate MLLM Global Orchestrator into the training framework to orchestrate multimodal data and tackle the issues arising from Modality Composition Incoherence. We evaluate OrchMLLM across various MLLM sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability. Experimental results reveal that OrchMLLM achieves a Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) of $41.6\%$ when training an 84B MLLM with three modalities on $2560$ H100 GPUs, outperforming Megatron-LM by up to $3.1\times$ in throughput.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains.

Previous methods have primarily enhanced model classification capabilities through post-training techniques. However, our analysis reveals that training for few-shot multimodal dialogue intention recognition involves two interconnected tasks, leading to a seesaw effect in multi-task learning. This phenomenon is attributed to knowledge interference stemming from the superposition of weight matrix updates during the training process. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge-Decoupled Synergetic Learning (KDSL), which mitigates these issues by utilizing smaller models to transform knowledge into interpretable rules, while applying the post-training of larger models. By facilitating collaboration between the large and small multimodal large language models for prediction, our approach demonstrates significant improvements. Notably, we achieve outstanding results on two real Taobao datasets, with enhancements of 6.37\% and 6.28\% in online weighted F1 scores compared to the state-of-the-art method, thereby validating the efficacy of our framework.</p></details> |  |

Although late-fusion two-tower architectures attempt to bridge this gap by independently encoding visual and textual data before merging them at a high level, they frequently overlook the subtle interplay essential for comprehensive understanding. In this work, we rigorously assess these limitations and introduce a unified retrieval framework that fuses visual and textual cues from the ground up, enabling early cross-modal interactions for enhancing context interpretation. Through a two-stage training process--comprising post-training adaptation followed by instruction tuning--we adapt MLLMs as retrievers using a simple one-tower architecture. Our approach outperforms conventional methods across diverse retrieval scenarios, particularly when processing complex multi-modal inputs. Notably, the joint fusion encoder yields greater improvements on tasks that require modality fusion compared to those that do not, underscoring the transformative potential of early integration strategies and pointing toward a promising direction for contextually aware and effective information retrieval.</p></details> |  |

In particular, LLaMA3 models have recently been released and have achieved impressive performance in various domains with super-large scale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of low-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios, we explore LLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration can potentially provide new insights and challenges for the low-bit quantization of LLaMA3 and other future LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation issues that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA fine-tuning (LoRA-FT) methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and various datasets to reveal the low-bit quantization performance of LLaMA3. To uncover the capabilities of low-bit quantized MLLM, we assessed the performance of the LLaMA3-based LLaVA-Next-8B model under 2-4 ultra-low bits with post-training quantization methods. Our experimental results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers from non-negligible degradation in linguistic and visual contexts, particularly under ultra-low bit widths. This highlights the significant performance gap at low bit-width that needs to be addressed in future developments. We expect that this empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, driving LLMs and MLLMs to achieve higher accuracy at lower bit to enhance practicality. Our project is released on https://github.com/Macaronlin/LLaMA3-Quantization , and quantized models are released at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-ML .</p></details> |  |

Recent hybrid MLLMs incorporate a mixture of vision experts to address the limitations of using a single vision encoder and excessively long visual tokens. Despite the progress of these MLLMs, a research gap remains in effectively integrating diverse vision encoders. This work explores fusion strategies of visual tokens for hybrid MLLMs, leading to the design of LEO, a novel MLLM with a dual-branch vision encoder framework that incorporates a post-adaptation fusion strategy and adaptive tiling: for each segmented tile of the input images, LEO sequentially interleaves the visual tokens from its two vision encoders. Extensive evaluation across 13 vision-language benchmarks reveals that LEO outperforms state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs and hybrid MLLMs on the majority of tasks. Furthermore, we show that LEO can be adapted to the specialized domain of autonomous driving without altering the model architecture or training recipe, achieving competitive performance compared to existing baselines.

In order to mitigate hallucinations, existing studies mainly resort to an instruction-tuning manner that requires retraining the models with specific data. In this paper, we pave a different way, introducing a training-free method named Woodpecker. Like a woodpecker heals trees, it picks out and corrects hallucinations from the generated text. Concretely, Woodpecker consists of five stages: key concept extraction, question formulation, visual knowledge validation, visual claim generation, and hallucination correction. Implemented in a post-remedy manner, Woodpecker can easily serve different MLLMs, while being interpretable by accessing intermediate outputs of the five stages. We evaluate Woodpecker both quantitatively and qualitatively and show the huge potential of this new paradigm. On the POPE benchmark, our method obtains a 30.66%/24.33% improvement in accuracy over the baseline MiniGPT-4/mPLUG-Owl.

However, recent studies reveal that CLIP has severe visual shortcomings, such as which can hardly distinguish orientation, quantity, color, structure, etc. These visual shortcomings also limit the perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) built on CLIP. The main reason could be that the image-text pairs used to train CLIP are inherently biased, due to the lack of the distinctiveness of the text and the diversity of images. In this work, we present a simple post-training approach for CLIP models, which largely overcomes its visual shortcomings via a self-supervised diffusion process. We introduce DIVA, which uses the DIffusion model as a Visual Assistant for CLIP. Specifically, DIVA leverages generative feedback from text-to-image diffusion models to optimize CLIP representations, with only images (without corresponding text). We demonstrate that DIVA improves CLIP's performance on the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark which assesses fine-grained visual abilities to a large extent (e.g., 3-7%), and enhances the performance of MLLMs and vision models on multimodal understanding and segmentation tasks. Extensive evaluation on 29 image classification and retrieval benchmarks confirms that our framework preserves CLIP's strong zero-shot capabilities.

Our approach employs a sequence of visual resamplers that capture visual details at various spacial scales. This architecture not only leverages global and local visual contexts effectively, but also facilitates the flexible extension of visual tokens through a compound token scaling strategy, allowing up to a 16x increase in the token count post pre-training. Consequently, Chain-of-Sight requires significantly fewer visual tokens in the pre-training phase compared to the fine-tuning phase. This intentional reduction of visual tokens during pre-training notably accelerates the pre-training process, cutting down the wall-clock training time by ~73%. Empirical results on a series of vision-language benchmarks reveal that the pre-train acceleration through Chain-of-Sight is achieved without sacrificing performance, matching or surpassing the standard pipeline of utilizing all visual tokens throughout the entire training process. Further scaling up the number of visual tokens for pre-training leads to stronger performances, competitive to existing approaches in a series of benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which are composed of the LLM base and visual projector (e.g. LLaVA), a significant decline in performance on language benchmarks was observed compared to their single-modality counterparts. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel model-agnostic self-decompression method, Tree Generation (TG), that decompresses knowledge within LLMs into the training corpus. This paper focuses on TG-SFT, which can synthetically generate SFT data for the instruction tuning steps. By incorporating the dumped corpus during SFT for MLLMs, we significantly reduce the forgetting problem.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most current models and benchmarks cater to scenarios with a narrow scope of visual and textual contexts. These models often fall short when faced with complex comprehension tasks, which involve navigating through a plethora of irrelevant and potentially misleading information in both text and image forms. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new, more demanding task known as Interleaved Image-Text Comprehension (IITC). This task challenges models to discern and disregard superfluous elements in both images and text to accurately answer questions and to follow intricate instructions to pinpoint the relevant image. In support of this task, we further craft a new VEGA dataset, tailored for the IITC task on scientific content, and devised a subtask, Image-Text Association (ITA), to refine image-text correlation skills. Our evaluation of four leading closed-source models, as well as various open-source models using VEGA, underscores the rigorous nature of IITC. Even the most advanced models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT4V, only achieved modest success. By employing a multi-task, multi-scale post-training strategy, we have set a robust baseline for MLLMs on the IITC task, attaining an $85.8\%$ accuracy rate in image association and a $0.508$ Rouge score. These results validate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving MLLMs capabilities for nuanced image-text comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zhourax.github.io/VEGA/</p></details> |
| **[Wings: Learning Multimodal LLMs without Text-only Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03496v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), initiated with a trained LLM, first align images with text and then fine-tune on multimodal mixed inputs. However, the MLLM catastrophically forgets the text-only instructions, which do not include images and can be addressed within the initial LLM. In this paper, we present Wings, a novel MLLM that excels in both text-only dialogues and multimodal comprehension. Analyzing MLLM attention in multimodal instructions reveals that text-only forgetting is related to the attention shifts from pre-image to post-image text. From that, we construct extra modules that act as the boosted learner to compensate for the attention shift. The complementary visual and textual learners, like "wings" on either side, are connected in parallel within each layer's attention block. Initially, image and text inputs are aligned with visual learners operating alongside the main attention, balancing focus on visual elements. Textual learners are later collaboratively integrated with attention-based routing to blend the outputs of the visual and textual learners. We design the Low-Rank Residual Attention (LoRRA) to guarantee high efficiency for learners. Our experimental results demonstrate that Wings outperforms equally-scaled MLLMs in both text-only and visual question-answering tasks. On a newly constructed Interleaved Image-Text (IIT) benchmark, Wings exhibits superior performance from text-only-rich to multimodal-rich question-answering tasks.</p></details> |  |

They need to explain themselves to us, and we need to trust their explanation. In this regard, explainability plays a critical role in trustworthy autonomous decision-making to foster transparency and acceptance among end users, especially in complex autonomous driving. Recent advancements in Multi-Modal Large Language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in enhancing the explainability as a driving agent by producing control predictions along with natural language explanations. However, severe data scarcity due to expensive annotation costs and significant domain gaps between different datasets makes the development of a robust and generalisable system an extremely challenging task. Moreover, the prohibitively expensive training requirements of MLLM and the unsolved problem of catastrophic forgetting further limit their generalisability post-deployment. To address these challenges, we present RAG-Driver, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-modal large language model that leverages in-context learning for high-performance, explainable, and generalisable autonomous driving. By grounding in retrieved expert demonstration, we empirically validate that RAG-Driver achieves state-of-the-art performance in producing driving action explanations, justifications, and control signal prediction. More importantly, it exhibits exceptional zero-shot generalisation capabilities to unseen environments without further training endeavours.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, little is known about how well their confidences are calibrated. In this paper, we comprehensively benchmark the calibration of several multilingual LLMs (MLLMs) on a variety of QA tasks. We perform extensive experiments, spanning encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only QA models (size varying from 110M to 7B parameters) and diverse languages, including both high- and low-resource ones. We study different dimensions of calibration in in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and cross-lingual transfer settings, and investigate strategies to improve it, including post-hoc methods and regularized fine-tuning. For decoder-only LLMs such as LlaMa2, we additionally find that in-context learning improves confidence calibration on multilingual data. We also conduct several ablation experiments to study the effect of language distances, language corpus size, and model size on calibration, and how multilingual models compare with their monolingual counterparts for diverse tasks and languages. Our experiments suggest that the multilingual QA models are poorly calibrated for languages other than English and incorporating a small set of cheaply translated multilingual samples during fine-tuning/calibration effectively enhances the calibration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, with the integration of additional modalities, MLLMs are exposed to new vulnerabilities, rendering them prone to structured-based jailbreak attacks, where semantic content (e.g., "harmful text") has been injected into the images to mislead MLLMs. In this work, we aim to defend against such threats. Specifically, we propose \textbf{Ada}ptive \textbf{Shield} Prompting (\textbf{AdaShield}), which prepends inputs with defense prompts to defend MLLMs against structure-based jailbreak attacks without fine-tuning MLLMs or training additional modules (e.g., post-stage content detector). Initially, we present a manually designed static defense prompt, which thoroughly examines the image and instruction content step by step and specifies response methods to malicious queries. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive auto-refinement framework, consisting of a target MLLM and a LLM-based defense prompt generator (Defender). These components collaboratively and iteratively communicate to generate a defense prompt. Extensive experiments on the popular structure-based jailbreak attacks and benign datasets show that our methods can consistently improve MLLMs' robustness against structure-based jailbreak attacks without compromising the model's general capabilities evaluated on standard benign tasks.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs and introduces a post-training adjustment method called Model Tailor. Our method primarily preserves the pre-trained parameters while replacing a small number ($\leq$ 10\%) of fine-tuned parameters, maintaining $\sim$ 99\% effectiveness on original tasks versus pre-training, and achieving $\sim$ 97\% on new tasks compared to standard fine-tuning. Specifically, we derive a sparse mask to identify the "model patch", based on a fusion strategy that integrates salience and sensitivity analysis. Subsequently, a compensation mechanism is introduced to "decorate the patch", enhancing the model's performance on both target and original tasks. Additionally, our method is adaptable to multi-task scenarios. Through extensive experiments on InstructBLIP and LLaVA-1.5 in both image captioning and visual question answering tasks, our approach demonstrates significant task adaptability while preserving inherent pre-trained capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We argue that fake image detection should not operate as a "black box". Instead, an ideal approach must ensure both strong generalization and transparency. Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers new opportunities for reasoning-based AI-generated image detection. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to traditional detection methods and human evaluators, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we design six distinct prompts and propose a framework that integrates these prompts to develop a more robust, explainable, and reasoning-driven detection system.

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and 28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30% and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 14 figures, under review as a conference paper</p></details> |

However, we reveal that this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we introduce ExGra-Med, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to large LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization. Empirically, ExGra-Med matches LLaVA-Med's performance using just 10% of the pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data performance. It also outperforms strong baselines like BioMedGPT and RadFM on visual chatbot and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its promise for efficient, high-quality vision-language integration in medical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmark Designers Should "Train on the Test Set" to Expose Exploitable Non-Visual Shortcuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04655v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be. Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns. We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology. Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing. Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an ``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider vision-blind performance gap than the original.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cambrian-mllm.github.io</p></details> |
| **[PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04601v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing, e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized, long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting, separating observation from judgment. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Benchmark for Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20426v4)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures.

However, their direct transfer to remote sensing (RS) is hindered by heterogeneous sensing physics, diverse modalities, and unique spatial scales. Existing RS MLLMs are mainly limited to optical imagery and plain language interaction, preventing flexible and scalable real-world applications. In this article, EarthGPT-X is proposed, the first flexible spatial MLLM that unifies multi-source RS imagery comprehension and accomplishes both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual tasks under diverse visual prompts in a single framework. Distinct from prior models, EarthGPT-X introduces: 1) a dual-prompt mechanism combining text instructions with various visual prompts (i.e., point, box, and free-form) to mimic the versatility of referring in human life; 2) a comprehensive multi-source multi-level prompting dataset, the model advances beyond holistic image understanding to support hierarchical spatial reasoning, including scene-level understanding and fine-grained object attributes and relational analysis; 3) a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy, enabling efficient and consistent alignment across modalities and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthGPT-X substantially outperforms prior nature and RS MLLMs, establishing the first framework capable of multi-source, multi-task, and multi-level interpretation using visual prompting in RS scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced capability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current thinking-\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as localization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic, and tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks, each requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in chain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from leading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use augmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and strong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities.

Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |

While WCAG-EM offers a structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work, we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks. Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking core stages of the audit pipeline.

| **[Benchmarking the Thinking Mode of Multimodal Large Language Models in Clinical Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode") alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these "dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MathOPEval: A Fine-grained Evaluation Benchmark for Visual Operations of MLLMs in Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18140v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2) Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation. To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual operations.</p></details> | Under Review |

These resourceful data from social media also introduce a significant and underexplored privacy risk: the inference of sensitive personal attributes from seemingly daily media content. However, the lack of benchmarks and comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art M-LLM capabilities hinders the research of private attribute profiling on social media. Accordingly, we propose (1) PRISM, the first multi-modal, multi-dimensional and fine-grained synthesized dataset incorporating a comprehensive privacy landscape and dynamic user history; (2) an Efficient evaluation framework that measures the cross-modal privacy inference capabilities of advanced M-LLM. Specifically, PRISM is a large-scale synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate cross-modal privacy risks. Its key feature is 12 sensitive attribute labels across a diverse set of multi-modal profiles, which enables targeted privacy analysis. These profiles are generated via a sophisticated LLM agentic workflow, governed by a prior distribution to ensure they realistically mimic social media users. Additionally, we propose a Multi-Agent Inference Framework that leverages a pipeline of specialized LLMs to enhance evaluation capabilities. We evaluate the inference capabilities of six leading M-LLMs (Qwen, Gemini, GPT-4o, GLM, Doubao, and Grok) on PRISM. The comparison with human performance reveals that these MLLMs significantly outperform in accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the threat of potential privacy risks and the urgent need for robust defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures; Accepted by MMM 2026; Complete version in progress</p></details> |

While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can MLLMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source MLLMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source MLLM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in MLLMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, code link: https://github.com/neu-vi/struct2d</p></details> |

Among the various forms of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge. We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones), rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin (Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and 105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.</p></details> |  |

Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 14 tables.

| **[QG-CoC: Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03206v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Bridging this gap, we propose ALTo, an adaptive length tokenizer for autoregressive mask generation. To achieve this, a novel token length predictor is designed, along with a length regularization term and a differentiable token chunking strategy. We further build ALToLLM that seamlessly integrates ALTo into MLLM. Preferences on the trade-offs between mask quality and efficiency is implemented by group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that ALToLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance with adaptive token cost on popular segmentation benchmarks. Code and models are released at https://github.com/yayafengzi/ALToLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MME-CC: A Challenging Multi-Modal Evaluation Benchmark of Cognitive Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03146v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As reasoning models scale rapidly, the essential role of multimodality in human cognition has come into sharp relief, driving a growing need to probe vision-centric cognitive behaviors. Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either overemphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs insufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC (Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded benchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three fundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and knowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs' cognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct extensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that closed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs. 30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak (less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns, including orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and poor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that Chain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason -> verify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a shift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both evaluation and model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Multi-modal Large Language Model to Boost Fireworks Algorithm's Ability in Settling Challenging Optimization Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03137v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities. Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on many problem instances.</p></details> |  |

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations. More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning (MAR) Workshop, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

A Multimodal Benchmark for Verifying Truthfulness in Multi-Party Social Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27195v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | ICCV2025 Workshop |

To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. \texttt{UniWorld-V2}, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available to support further research.</p></details> |  |

These limitations: \textit{narrow-source heterogeneity (single/few data sources), constrained scientific granularity, and limited-sphere extensibility}. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{OmniEarth-Bench}, the first multimodal benchmark that systematically spans all six spheres: atmosphere, lithosphere, oceanosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and human-activity sphere, and cross-spheres. Built with a scalable, modular-topology data inference framework and native multi-observation sources and expert-in-the-loop curation, OmniEarth-Bench produces 29,855 standardized, expert-curated annotations. All annotations are organized into a four-level hierarchy (Sphere, Scenario, Ability, Task), encompassing 109 expert-curated evaluation tasks. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35\% accuracy, revealing systematic gaps in Earth-system cognitive ability. The dataset and evaluation code were released at OmniEarth-Bench (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OmniEarth-Bench-B1BD).</p></details> |  |

However, current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications. This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions, thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations. Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex chart comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, EMNLP25 Accepted</p></details> |

Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MMGenSR Workshop (CIKM 2025)</p></details> |

In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAIL-RL: Guiding MLLMs in When and How to Think via Dual-Reward RL Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02280v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward, which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Modalities Conflict: How Unimodal Reasoning Uncertainty Governs Preference Dynamics in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02243v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty (the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs. Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law: the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions, we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.</p></details> | 19 pages |

This approach may not encourage deep integration of modalities, limiting the model's ability to leverage the core language model's reasoning capabilities. This work examined the impact of interleaved instruction tuning in an audio MLLM, where audio tokens are interleaved within the prompt. Using the Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU) model as a testbed, we conduct an experiment using the Synonym and Hypernym Audio Reasoning Dataset (SHARD), our newly created reasoning benchmark for audio-based semantic reasoning focusing on synonym and hypernym recognition. Our findings show that while even zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks, a small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamPRM: Domain-Reweighted Process Reward Model for Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20241v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage. However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |

Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with MLLM, the advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves strong performance across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications. In addition, Sa2VA can be easily extended into various VLMs, including Qwen-VL and Intern-VL, which can be updated with rapid process in current open-sourced VLMs. Code and models have been provided to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Bytedance/Sa2VA</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate layer-wise redundancy in MLLMs by introducing a novel metric, Layer Contribution (LC), which quantifies the impact of a layer's transformations on visual and text tokens, respectively. The calculation of LC involves measuring the divergence in model output that results from removing the layer's transformations on the specified tokens. Our pilot experiment reveals that many layers of MLLMs exhibit minimal contribution during the processing of visual tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose ShortV, a training-free method that leverages LC to identify ineffective layers, and freezes visual token updates in these layers. Experiments show that ShortV can freeze visual token in approximately 60\% of the MLLM layers, thereby dramatically reducing computational costs related to updating visual tokens. For example, it achieves a 50\% reduction in FLOPs on LLaVA-NeXT-13B while maintaining superior performance.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion-based Restoration Models via Difficulty-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning with IQA Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01645v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been incorporated into diffusion models, e.g., tasks such as text-to-image. However, directly applying existing RL methods to diffusion-based image restoration models is suboptimal, as the objective of restoration fundamentally differs from that of pure generation: it places greater emphasis on fidelity. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First, through extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an effective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model, instead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been optimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Moreover, our strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly distant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented using MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images initially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is adaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic process is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts based on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is plug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration models, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RL framework.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear whether these models can effectively capture the detailed spatial information required for robust real-world performance, especially cross-view consistency, a key requirement for accurate 3D reasoning. Considering this issue, we introduce Viewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We present the Viewpoint-100K dataset, consisting of 100K object-centric image pairs with diverse viewpoints and corresponding question-answer pairs. Our approach employs a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: first, foundational knowledge is injected to the baseline MLLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on Viewpoint-100K, resulting in significant improvements across multiple tasks; second, generalization is enhanced through Reinforcement Learning using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm on a broader set of questions. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid cold-start initialization method designed to simultaneously learn viewpoint representations and maintain coherent reasoning thinking. Experimental results show that our approach significantly activates the spatial reasoning ability of MLLM, improving performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Our findings highlight the value of developing foundational spatial skills in MLLMs, supporting future progress in robotics, autonomous systems, and 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MARS - a Multi-Agent Robotic System powered by MLLMs for assistive intelligence and designed for smart home robots supporting people with disabilities. The system integrates four agents: a visual perception agent for extracting semantic and spatial features from environment images, a risk assessment agent for identifying and prioritizing hazards, a planning agent for generating executable action sequences, and an evaluation agent for iterative optimization. By combining multimodal perception with hierarchical multi-agent decision-making, the framework enables adaptive, risk-aware, and personalized assistance in dynamic indoor environments. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance of the proposed system in risk-aware planning and coordinated multi-agent execution compared with state-of-the-art multimodal models. The proposed approach also highlights the potential of collaborative AI for practical assistive scenarios and provides a generalizable methodology for deploying MLLM-enabled multi-agent systems in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 1 table; under review at Multimedia Systems (Springer)</p></details> |
| **[Wave-Particle (Continuous-Discrete) Dualistic Visual Tokenization for Unified Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01593v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unification of understanding and generation within a single multi-modal large model (MLLM) remains one significant challenge, largely due to the dichotomy between continuous and discrete visual tokenizations. Continuous tokenizer (CT) achieves strong performance by bridging multiple independently-trained understanding modules and generation modules, but suffers from complex multi-stage pipelines and substantial engineering overhead. Conversely, discrete tokenizers (DT) offer a conceptually elegant idea by quantizing each image into a primitive, but inevitably leading to information loss and performance degradation. To resolve this tension, we question the binary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of light, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT). We treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from quantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number assigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its complexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete tokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous tokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative Primitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate information space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample complexity to determine the optimal set of primitives. Extensive experiments on reconstruction, retrieval and classification show that CDD-VT achieves superior performance over to specialized CT and DT, effectively getting strong result within a concise and scalable MLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explore More, Learn Better: Parallel MLLM Embeddings under Mutual Information Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01588v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models are a cornerstone of modern AI. Driven by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have made great progress in architecture and data curation, while the holistic paradigm is still limited to SSC, i.e., single input, singular embedding, contrastive supervision, which collapses rich, multifaceted inputs into monolithic embeddings and fails to fully exploit MLLM capabilities. In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF) for multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of MLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response under explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone on distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one input, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote full parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an explicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain semantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic coverage and a generalizable embedding space. Ultimately, the remarkable embedding space are accessible at inference via one single forward pass, incurring negligible computational overhead. We instantiate PDF on multiple MLLM backbones and prove its effectiveness on MMEB benchmark. Significant gains are consistently achieved across various resolutions and model sizes, e.g., boosting the VLM2Vec-LLaVA-1.6-LR model by a remarkable +8.9% (7B), while the VLM2Vec-Qwen2VL models by +4.2% (2B) and +3.1% (7B). In terms of efficiency, our 2B model surpasses its baseline by +2.6% using only half the computational budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEPS: Semantic-enhanced Patch Slimming Framework for fine-grained cross-modal alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01390v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained cross-modal alignment aims to establish precise local correspondences between vision and language, forming a cornerstone for visual question answering and related multimodal applications. Current approaches face challenges in addressing patch redundancy and ambiguity, which arise from the inherent information density disparities across modalities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as promising solutions to bridge this gap through their robust semantic generation capabilities. However, the dense textual outputs from MLLMs may introduce conflicts with the original sparse captions. Furthermore, accurately quantifying semantic relevance between rich visual patches and concise textual descriptions remains a core challenge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Semantic-Enhanced Patch Slimming (SEPS) framework, which systematically addresses patch redundancy and ambiguity. Our approach employs a two-stage mechanism to integrate unified semantics from both dense and sparse texts, enabling the identification of salient visual patches. Additionally, it leverages relevance-aware selection with mean value computation to highlight crucial patch-word correspondences, thereby improving cross-modal similarity assessment. Comprehensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets validate that SEPS achieves superior performance, surpassing existing approaches by 23\%-86\% in rSum across diverse model architectures, with notable enhancements in text-to-image retrieval scenarios. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Sweet4tars/seps.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Effective Tokens with Video Anomaly in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06350v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

EgoBlind comprises 1,392 first-person videos from the daily lives of blind and visually impaired individuals. It also features 5,311 questions directly posed or verified by the blind to reflect their in-situation needs for visual assistance. Each question has an average of 3 manually annotated reference answers to reduce subjectiveness. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 16 advanced MLLMs and find that all models struggle. The best performers achieve an accuracy near 60\%, which is far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and explore heuristic solutions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope that EgoBlind will serve as a foundation for developing effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind and visually impaired.

Drone photographs, with their advantages of easy acquisition, broad coverage, and high spatial resolution, offer a viable approach for large-scale rural environmental perception. However, a systematic methodology for identifying key environmental elements from drone photographs and quantifying their impact on environmental perception remains lacking. To address this gap, a Vision-Language Contrastive Ranking Framework (VLCR) is designed for rural livability assessment in China. The framework employs chain-of-thought prompting strategies to guide multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in identifying visual features related to quality of life and ecological habitability from drone photographs. Subsequently, to address the instability in pairwise village comparison, a text description-constrained drone photograph comparison strategy is proposed. Finally, to overcome the efficiency bottleneck in nationwide pairwise village comparisons, an innovation ranking algorithm based on binary search interpolation is developed, which reduces the number of comparisons through automated selection of comparison targets. The proposed framework achieves superior performance with a Spearman Footrule distance of 0.74, outperforming mainstream commercial MLLMs by approximately 0.1. Moreover, the mechanism of concurrent comparison and ranking demonstrates a threefold enhancement in computational efficiency. Our framework has achieved data innovation and methodological breakthroughs in village livability assessment, providing strong support for large-scale village livability analysis.

However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image.

In this setting, the model responds to a text query by generating an identifier corresponding to the target image. However, existing methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels, or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs. These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pl...</summary><p>We plan to revise the methodology and update the experimental analysis before resubmission</p></details> |

However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines.

To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. Our approach addresses this critical gap by providing a systematic framework for generating spatially coherent data. In this work, we introduce SKG2DATA, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2DATA employs an automated pipeline for constructing Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) that effectively captures human-like spatial cognition, including directional and distance relationships. These structured representations then serve as precise guidance for our integrated synthesis pipeline, where a diffusion model generates spatially-consistent images while a MLLM produces corresponding textual descriptions. The automated construction of SKG enables scalable generation of diverse yet realistic spatial configurations, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs markedly, albeit with a slight cost to their general capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence.

To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical sequence prediction approach inspired by how humans narrow down locations from broad regions to specific addresses. Analogously, our model predicts geographic tokens hierarchically, first identifying a general region and then sequentially refining predictions to increasingly precise locations. Rather than relying on explicit semantic partitions, our method uses S2 cells, a nested, multiresolution global grid, and sequentially predicts finer-level cells conditioned on visual inputs and previous predictions. This procedure mirrors autoregressive text generation in large language models. Much like in language modeling, final performance depends not only on training but also on inference-time strategy. We investigate multiple top-down traversal methods for autoregressive sampling, incorporating techniques from test-time compute scaling used in language models. Specifically, we integrate beam search and multi-sample inference while exploring various selection strategies to determine the final output. This enables the model to manage uncertainty by exploring multiple plausible paths through the hierarchy. We evaluate our method on the Im2GPS3k and YFCC4k datasets against two distinct sets of baselines: those that operate without a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and those that leverage one. In the MLLM-free setting, our model surpasses other comparable baselines on nearly all metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accuracy gains of up to 13.9%. When augmented with an MLLM, our model outperforms all baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across all metrics.

Currently, training-based solutions, like direct preference optimization (DPO), leverage paired preference data to suppress hallucinations. However, they risk sacrificing general reasoning capabilities due to the likelihood displacement. Meanwhile, training-free solutions, like contrastive decoding, achieve this goal by subtracting the estimated hallucination pattern from a distorted input. Yet, these handcrafted perturbations (e.g., add noise to images) may poorly capture authentic hallucination patterns. To avoid these weaknesses of existing methods, and realize robust hallucination mitigation (i.e., maintaining general reasoning performance), we propose a novel framework: Decoupling Contrastive Decoding (DCD). Specifically, DCD decouples the learning of positive and negative samples in preference datasets, and trains separate positive and negative image projections within the MLLM. The negative projection implicitly models real hallucination patterns, which enables vision-aware negative images in the contrastive decoding inference stage. Our DCD alleviates likelihood displacement by avoiding pairwise optimization and generalizes robustly without handcrafted degradation. Extensive ablations across hallucination benchmarks and general reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DCD, i.e., it matches DPO's hallucination suppression while preserving general capabilities and outperforms the handcrafted contrastive decoding methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing methods often rely on panoramic observations and two-stage pipelines involving waypoint predictors, which introduce significant latency and limit real-world applicability. In this work, we propose Fast-SmartWay, an end-to-end zero-shot VLN-CE framework that eliminates the need for panoramic views and waypoint predictors. Our approach uses only three frontal RGB-D images combined with natural language instructions, enabling MLLMs to directly predict actions. To enhance decision robustness, we introduce an Uncertainty-Aware Reasoning module that integrates (i) a Disambiguation Module for avoiding local optima, and (ii) a Future-Past Bidirectional Reasoning mechanism for globally coherent planning. Experiments on both simulated and real-robot environments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces per-step latency while achieving competitive or superior performance compared to panoramic-view baselines.

Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities. Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented 2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.</p></details> | 82 pages |

Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks can be found at https://github.com/zhengxuJosh/Awesome-Spatial-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, current brain-oriented visual question-answering (VQA) benchmarks either cover a few imaging modalities or are limited to coarse-grained pathological descriptions, hindering a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs throughout the full clinical continuum. To address these, we introduce OmniBrainBench, the first comprehensive multimodal VQA benchmark specifically designed to assess the multimodal comprehension capabilities of MLLMs in brain imaging analysis.OmniBrainBench consists of 15 distinct brain imaging modalities collected from 30 verified medical sources, yielding 9,527 validated VQA pairs and 31,706 images. It simulates clinical workflows and encompasses 15 multi-stage clinical tasks rigorously validated by a professional radiologist. Evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art models, including open-source, medical, and proprietary MLLMs, highlights the substantial challenges posed by OmniBrainBench. Our experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) beat open-source and medical models but lag physicians; (2) medical MLLMs vary widely in performance; (3) open-source MLLMs trail overall but excel in specific tasks; (4) MLLMs underperform sharply in complex preoperative tasks, revealing a visual-to-clinical reasoning gap. OmniBrainBench sets a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in brain imaging analysis, highlighting gaps compared to expert clinical reasoning. We release it at benchmark \& code.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUI-AIMA: Aligning Intrinsic Multimodal Attention with a Context Anchor for GUI Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00810v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a key function of computer-use agents, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable screen regions. Existing approaches based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically formulate it as a text-based coordinate generation task, yet directly generating precise coordinates from visual inputs remains challenging and computationally intensive. An intuitive way to implement GUI grounding is to first select visual patches relevant to the instructions and then determine the precise click location within those patches. Based on the observations that general MLLMs have some native grounding capability, nested within their attentions, we propose GUI-AIMA, an attention-based and coordinate-free supervised fine-tuning framework for efficient GUI grounding. GUI-AIMA aligns the intrinsic multimodal attention of MLLMs with patch-wise grounding signals. These signals are calculated adaptively for diverse user instructions by multi-head aggregation on simplified query-visual attention matrices. Besides, its coordinate-free manner can easily integrate a plug-and-play zoom-in stage. GUI-AIMA-3B was trained with only 85k screenshots, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and verifying that light training can trigger the native grounding capability of MLLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among 3B models, attaining an average accuracy of 58.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro and 62.2% on OSWorld-G.

| **[FESTA: Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment of Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16648v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |

Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reimagining Safety Alignment with An Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00509v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications but face dual challenges: generating harmful content under jailbreak attacks and over-refusal of benign queries due to rigid safety mechanisms. These issues are further complicated by the need to accommodate different value systems and precisely align with given safety preferences. Moreover, traditional methods like SFT and RLHF lack this capability due to their costly parameter tuning requirements and inability to support multiple value systems within a single model. These problems are more obvious in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in terms of heightened over-refusal in cross-modal tasks and new security risks arising from expanded attack surfaces. We propose Magic Image, an optimization-driven visual prompt framework that enhances security while reducing over-refusal. By optimizing image prompts using harmful/benign samples, our method enables a single model to adapt to different value systems and better align with given safety preferences without parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate improved safety-effectiveness balance across diverse datasets while preserving model performance, offering a practical solution for deployable MLLM safety alignment.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the gap by introducing Bhili-Hindi-English Parallel Corpus (BHEPC), the first and largest parallel corpus worldwide comprising 110,000 meticulously curated sentences across Bhili, Hindi, and English. The corpus was created with the assistance of expert human translators. BHEPC spans critical domains such as education, administration, and news, establishing a valuable benchmark for research in low resource machine translation. To establish a comprehensive Bhili Machine Translation benchmark, we evaluated a wide range of proprietary and open-source Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs) on bidirectional translation tasks between English/Hindi and Bhili. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned NLLB-200 distilled 600M variant model outperforms others, highlighting the potential of multilingual models in low resource scenarios. Furthermore, we investigated the generative translation capabilities of multilingual LLMs on BHEPC using in-context learning, assessing performance under cross-domain generalization and quantifying distributional divergence. This work bridges a critical resource gap and promotes inclusive natural language processing technologies for low-resource and marginalized languages globally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust Evaluation of STEM Education: Leveraging MLLMs in Project-Based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17050v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Project-Based Learning (PBL) involves a variety of highly correlated multimodal data, making it a vital educational approach within STEM disciplines. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks. Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[PixelRefer: A Unified Framework for Spatio-Temporal Object Referring with Arbitrary Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23603v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Enhancing Adversarial Transferability by Balancing Exploration and Exploitation with Gradient-Guided Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00411v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks present a critical challenge to deep neural networks' robustness, particularly in transfer scenarios across different model architectures. However, the transferability of adversarial attacks faces a fundamental dilemma between Exploitation (maximizing attack potency) and Exploration (enhancing cross-model generalization). Traditional momentum-based methods over-prioritize Exploitation, i.e., higher loss maxima for attack potency but weakened generalization (narrow loss surface). Conversely, recent methods with inner-iteration sampling over-prioritize Exploration, i.e., flatter loss surfaces for cross-model generalization but weakened attack potency (suboptimal local maxima). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple yet effective Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS), which harmonizes both objectives through guiding sampling along the gradient ascent direction to improve both sampling efficiency and stability. Specifically, based on MI-FGSM, GGS introduces inner-iteration random sampling and guides the sampling direction using the gradient from the previous inner-iteration (the sampling's magnitude is determined by a random distribution). This mechanism encourages adversarial examples to reside in balanced regions with both flatness for cross-model generalization and higher local maxima for strong attack potency. Comprehensive experiments across multiple DNN architectures and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art transfer attacks.

| **[UME-R1: Exploring Reasoning-Driven Generative Multimodal Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00405v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable success of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven advances in multimodal embeddings, yet existing models remain inherently discriminative, limiting their ability to benefit from reasoning-driven generation paradigm. In this work, we pioneer the exploration of generative embeddings, unifying embedding tasks within a generative paradigm. We propose UME-R1, a universal multimodal embedding framework consisting of a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning equips the model with reasoning capabilities and enables it to generate both discriminative and generative embeddings; a subsequent reinforcement learning enhances reasoning and further optimizes generative embedding quality. This pioneering work reveals four key insights: 1) generative embeddings unlock substantial performance gains over conventional discriminative embeddings by leveraging the powerful generative reasoning capabilities of MLLMs; 2) discriminative and generative embeddings are complementary, whose combined oracle performance far exceeding that of either alone; 3) RL can effectively enhance generative embeddings, establishing a scalable optimization paradigm.; 4) repeated sampling at inference boosts downstream task coverage (pass@k), highlighting the inference-time scalability potential of generative embeddings. Evaluated on the MMEB-V2 benchmark across 78 tasks spanning video, image, and visual documents, UME-R1 significantly outperforms conventional discriminative embedding models and offers a foundation for more interpretable, reasoning-driven generative multimodal embeddings. Our code, models, and datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/UME-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Facial Expression Recognition in the Era of Multimodal Large Language Models: Benchmark, Datasets, and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00389v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized numerous research fields, including computer vision and affective computing. As a pivotal challenge in this interdisciplinary domain, facial expression recognition (FER) has evolved from separate, domain-specific models to more unified approaches. One promising avenue to unify FER tasks is converting conventional FER datasets into visual question-answering (VQA) formats, enabling the direct application of powerful generalist MLLMs for inference. However, despite the success of cutting-edge MLLMs in various tasks, their performance on FER tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we provide FERBench, a systematic benchmark that incorporates 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs across four widely used FER datasets. Our results reveal that, while MLLMs exhibit good classification performance, they still face significant limitations in reasoning and interpretability. To this end, we introduce post-training strategies aimed at enhancing the facial expression reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, we curate two high-quality and large-scale datasets: UniFER-CoT-230K for cold-start initialization and UniFER-RLVR-360K for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), respectively. Building upon them, we develop a unified and interpretable FER foundation model termed UniFER-7B, which outperforms many open-sourced and closed-source generalist MLLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro and Qwen2.5-VL-72B).</p></details> |  |
| **[CompAgent: An Agentic Framework for Visual Compliance Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00171v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual compliance verification is a critical yet underexplored problem in computer vision, especially in domains such as media, entertainment, and advertising where content must adhere to complex and evolving policy rules. Existing methods often rely on task-specific deep learning models trained on manually labeled datasets, which are costly to build and limited in generalizability. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) offer broad real-world knowledge and policy understanding, they struggle to reason over fine-grained visual details and apply structured compliance rules effectively on their own. In this paper, we propose CompAgent, the first agentic framework for visual compliance verification. CompAgent augments MLLMs with a suite of visual tools - such as object detectors, face analyzers, NSFW detectors, and captioning models - and introduces a planning agent that dynamically selects appropriate tools based on the compliance policy. A verification agent then integrates image, tool outputs, and policy context to perform multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on public benchmarks show that CompAgent outperforms specialized classifiers, direct MLLM prompting, and curated routing baselines, achieving up to 76% F1 score and a 10% improvement over the state-of-the-art on the UnsafeBench dataset. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of agentic planning and tool-augmented reasoning for scalable, accurate, and adaptable visual compliance verification.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Visual Backdoor Attacks on MLLM Embodied Decision Making via Contrastive Trigger Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27623v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data. These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoFM: Enhancing Geometric Reasoning of MLLMs via Synthetic Data Generation through Formal Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27448v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space, generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA. Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by 5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherently complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains, including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up to +6.69% across all datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images, offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements. Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch. Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities. We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available in https://huggingface.co/qihoo360/RzenEmbed.</p></details> |  |

Given an image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy.

| **[FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergistic Tensor and Pipeline Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27257v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the machine learning system, the hybrid model parallelism combining tensor parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) has become the dominant solution for distributed training of Large Language Models~(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, TP introduces significant collective communication overheads, while PP suffers from synchronization inefficiencies such as pipeline bubbles. Existing works primarily address these challenges from isolated perspectives, focusing either on overlapping TP communication or on flexible PP scheduling to mitigate pipeline bubbles. In this paper, we propose a new synergistic tensor and pipeline parallelism schedule that simultaneously reduces both types of bubbles. Our proposed schedule decouples the forward and backward passes in PP into fine-grained computation units, which are then braided to form a composite computation sequence. This compositional structure enables near-complete elimination of TP-related bubbles. Building upon this structure, we further design the PP schedule to minimize PP bubbles. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves training throughput by up to 12% for LLMs and 16% for MLLMs compared to existing scheduling methods.

However, traditional manual and computer-assisted systems are limited in real-time accessibility and articulatory motion feedback. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, especially through their adaptive assessment and therapeutic feedback capabilities. Nevertheless, challenges including insufficient acquisition and fusion of articulatory information, inadequate parsing of articulatory organ motion trajectories, and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets hinder the application of MLLMs in speech therapy. To address these limitations, we propose an MLLM-based speech rehabilitation assistance system that leverages ultrasound tongue imaging and speech signals to deliver precise, interactive articulatory feedback. We construct a high-quality domain-specific dataset comprising ultrasound-speech dialogue pairs. This dataset facilitates fine-tuning to enhance the model's clinical adaptability. Furthermore, our method develops spatiotemporal fusion training strategy of ultrasound videos and speech signals, enabling fine-grained articulatory impairment analysis and ultimately generating actionable feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in articulatory analysis and clinical assessment.</p></details> |  |

We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning, which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent, \textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.

Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs' detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs' understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences, offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in multimodal harmfulness understanding.

However, existing MRAG frameworks primarily adhere to rigid, single-step retrieval strategies that fail to address real-world challenges of information acquisition and query reformulation. In this work, we introduce the task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning) that aims at effective information seeking and integration while minimizing computational overhead. Specifically, we propose CogPlanner, an agentic plug-and-play framework inspired by human cognitive processes, which iteratively determines query reformulation and retrieval strategies to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. CogPlanner supports parallel and sequential modeling paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce CogBench, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the MRAG Planning task and facilitate lightweight CogPlanner integration with resource-efficient MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B-Cog. Experimental results demonstrate that CogPlanner significantly outperforms existing MRAG baselines, offering improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal additional computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

| **[Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely from external data factors.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Open3D-VQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to reason about complex spatial relationships from an aerial perspective. The benchmark comprises 73k QA pairs spanning 7 general spatial reasoning tasks, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer formats, and supports both visual and point cloud modalities. The questions are automatically generated from spatial relations extracted from both real-world and simulated aerial scenes. Evaluation on 13 popular MLLMs reveals that: 1) Models are generally better at answering questions about relative spatial relations than absolute distances, 2) 3D LLMs fail to demonstrate significant advantages over 2D LLMs, and 3) Fine-tuning solely on the simulated dataset can significantly improve the model's spatial reasoning performance in real-world scenarios. We release our benchmark, data generation pipeline, and evaluation toolkit to support further research: https://github.com/EmbodiedCity/Open3D-VQA.code.</p></details> |  |
| **[OracleAgent: A Multimodal Reasoning Agent for Oracle Bone Script Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26114v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However, current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks, and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for, compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS, which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing Multimodal Causality with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17784v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering cause-and-effect mechanisms from data is fundamental to scientific progress. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2) insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Temporal Understanding in Video-LLMs through Stacked Temporal Attention in Vision Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26027v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge. Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are available at: https://alirasekh.github.io/STAVEQ2/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Think Then Embed: Generative Context Improves Multimodal Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05014v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only an 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, we observe that MLLMs are affected by a recency bias, where placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements of up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context.

This leaves the community without foundational knowledge about how to build high-quality feedback with open-source MLLMs. In this work, we introduce RLAIF-V, a novel framework that aligns MLLMs in a fully open-source paradigm. RLAIF-V maximally explores open-source MLLMs from two perspectives, including high-quality feedback data generation for preference learning and self-feedback guidance for inference-time scaling. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks in both automatic and human evaluation show that RLAIF-V substantially enhances the trustworthiness of models at both preference learning and inference time. RLAIF-V 7B reduces object hallucination by 80.7\% and overall hallucination by 33.7\%. Remarkably, RLAIF-V 12B further reveals the self-alignment potential of open-source MLLMs, where the model can learn from feedback of itself to achieve super GPT-4V trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://github.com/RLHF-V/RLAIF-V</p></details> |

Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range (0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[FOCUS: Internal MLLM Representations for Efficient Fine-Grained Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21710v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA) focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations: the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations. We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps: first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA datasets and three types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 - main track.

They typically require extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\% additional parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art works like BAGEL face limitations, including detail degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to their reliance on random noise initialization. To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient solution without compromising editing quality.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning, existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1) Noise-Injected Exploration Policy: Perturbing visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual scenarios; and (2) Bayesian Advantage Estimation: Formulating advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones. Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

However, existing visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding. We release InfoChartQA at https://github.com/CoolDawnAnt/InfoChartQA.</p></details> |  |
