| **[AI-Augmented Thyroid Scintigraphy for Robust Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00366v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Thyroid scintigraphy plays a vital role in diagnosing a range of thyroid disorders. While deep learning classification models hold significant promise in this domain, their effectiveness is frequently compromised by limited and imbalanced datasets. This study investigates the impact of three data augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a ResNet18 classifier. Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine medical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID). Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context. O+FM+CA yielded the most balanced and robust performance across all classes. Conclusion: Integrating FM and clinically-informed SD augmentation, especially when guided by expert prompts, substantially improves thyroid scintigraphy classification. These findings highlight the importance of leveraging both structured medical input and advanced generative models for more effective training on limited datasets.</p></details> |  |

Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each block builds on the representation of the block below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top blocks of the model, while features on lower blocks are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation across the entire network. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each block independently learns to denoise a noisy target using only local targets and back-propagation within the block. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of learning methods that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each block beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm, is easy to use and computationally efficient. By departing from the traditional learning paradigm which requires back-propagating a global error signal, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for CoLLAs 2025</p></details> |
| **[Noise Matters: Optimizing Matching Noise for Diffusion Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11330v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising effects with different category conditions to classify categories. Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles, we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good) noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of NoOp.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Diffusion via Generalized Opinion Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11249v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3) theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

In particular, generative AI-led by diffusion models and transformer architectures-has enabled significant breakthroughs in medical imaging (including image reconstruction, image-to-image translation, generation, and classification), protein structure prediction, clinical documentation, diagnostic assistance, radiology interpretation, clinical decision support, medical coding, and billing, as well as drug design and molecular representation. These innovations have enhanced clinical diagnosis, data reconstruction, and drug synthesis. This review paper aims to offer a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in healthcare applications of generative AI, with an emphasis on diffusion and transformer models. Moreover, we discuss current capabilities, highlight existing limitations, and outline promising research directions to address emerging challenges. Serving as both a reference for researchers and a guide for practitioners, this work offers an integrated view of the state of the art, its impact on healthcare, and its future potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 16 figures, 1table</p></details> |
| **[Match & Choose: Model Selection Framework for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10993v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model for the rest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of small-ball modes and maximum a posteriori estimators in metric spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16278v4)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A mode, or `most likely point', for a probability measure $\mu$ can be defined in various ways via the asymptotic behaviour of the $\mu$-mass of balls as their radius tends to zero. Such points are of intrinsic interest in the local theory of measures on metric spaces and also arise naturally in the study of Bayesian inverse problems and diffusion processes. Building upon special cases already proposed in the literature, this paper develops a systematic framework for defining modes through small-ball probabilities. We propose `common-sense' axioms that such definitions should obey, including appropriate treatment of discrete and absolutely continuous measures, as well as symmetry and invariance properties. We show that there are exactly ten such definitions consistent with these axioms, and that they are partially but not totally ordered in strength, forming a complete, distributive lattice. We also show how this classification simplifies for well-behaved $\mu$.</p></details> | 63 pages |
| **[DiffAxE: Diffusion-driven Hardware Accelerator Generation and Design Space Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10303v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration. As model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17), becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from design configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based optimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less complex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable, non-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search. We further extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and 1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17) design spaces. For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DOSA framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 24 figures, 8 tables, 54 references</p></details> |
| **[Non-asymptotic convergence bound of conditional diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10944v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning and generating various types of data based on conditional diffusion models has been a research hotspot in recent years. Although conditional diffusion models have made considerable progress in improving acceleration algorithms and enhancing generation quality, the lack of non-asymptotic properties has hindered theoretical research. To address this gap, we focus on a conditional diffusion model within the domains of classification and regression (CARD), which aims to learn the original distribution with given input x (denoted as Y|X). It innovatively integrates a pre-trained model f_{\phi}(x) into the original diffusion model framework, allowing it to precisely capture the original conditional distribution given f (expressed as Y|f_{\phi}(x)). Remarkably, when f_{\phi}(x) performs satisfactorily, Y|f_{\phi}(x) closely approximates Y|X. Theoretically, we deduce the stochastic differential equations of CARD and establish its generalized form predicated on the Fokker-Planck equation, thereby erecting a firm theoretical foundation for analysis. Mainly under the Lipschitz assumptions, we utilize the second-order Wasserstein distance to demonstrate the upper error bound between the original and the generated conditional distributions. Additionally, by appending assumptions such as light-tailedness to the original distribution, we derive the convergence upper bound between the true value analogous to the score function and the corresponding network-estimated value.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProtoECGNet: Case-Based Interpretable Deep Learning for Multi-Label ECG Classification with Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08713v5)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PMLR 298, 10th Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (MLHC)</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusing the Blind Spot: Uterine MRI Synthesis with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07903v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images, limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI CAPI 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Situ Fine-Tuning of Wildlife Models in IoT-Enabled Camera Traps for Efficient Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07796v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models, however, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Our background-aware synthesis surpasses efficient baselines by 7.3\% and diffusion models by 3.0\% while being orders of magnitude faster, our drift-aware fine-tuning achieves Pareto optimality with 50\% fewer updates and 1.5\% higher accuracy, and the end-to-end system outperforms domain adaptation approaches by 20--35%\% while consuming only 11.2 Wh over 37 days -- enabling battery-powered deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task Adversarial Attacks against Black-box Model with Few-shot Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10039v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble \textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a \textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and allowing attacks across various tasks. CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks substitute models. In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100 queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Conditional Diffusion Models for Forecasting Future Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Masks Conditioned on Treatments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07006v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare, particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (LMID Workshop)</p></details> |
| **[MatCLIP: Light- and Shape-Insensitive Assignment of PBR Material Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15981v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assigning realistic materials to 3D models remains a significant challenge in computer graphics. We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGGRAPH 2025 (Conference Track).

| **[Towards Robust Red-Green Watermarking for Autoregressive Image Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06656v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive (AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images. Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality. Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime, comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Diffusion Models are Medical Image Classifiers that Provide Explainability and Uncertainty for Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03687v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

| **[Improving Diagnostic Accuracy for Oral Cancer with inpainting Synthesis Lesions Generated Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06151v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Sub-Visible Particle Classification in Flow Imaging Microscopy via Generative AI-Based Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06021v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles. However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure. To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising 500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at https://github.com/utkuozbulak/svp-generative-ai.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11772v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing, tackling the challenge of limited generalization in task-oriented synthesis for RSI interpretation. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy with a three-dimensional batch-sample selection mechanism to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios. There are significant improvements in open-vocabulary understanding tasks, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.</p></details> | 25 pages |

This is particularly advantageous in diffused lung disease research, where annotated imaging datasets are scarce. To leverage this, we train an MAE on a curated collection of over 5,000 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, combining in-house data with publicly available scans from related conditions that exhibit similar radiological patterns, such as COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The pretrained MAE is then fine-tuned on a downstream classification task for diffused lung disease diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that MAEs can effectively extract clinically meaningful features and improve diagnostic performance, even in the absence of large-scale labelled datasets. The code and the models are available here: https://github.com/eedack01/lung_masked_autoencoder.</p></details> |  |

One vital component often found in such document processing workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use, remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain the decisions of document image classification models through feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3 different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP-DocLDM: Differentially Private Document Image Generation using Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04208v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep learning-based, data-driven information extraction systems become increasingly integrated into modern document processing workflows, one primary concern is the risk of malicious leakage of sensitive private data from these systems. While some recent works have explored Differential Privacy (DP) to mitigate these privacy risks, DP-based training is known to cause significant performance degradation and impose several limitations on standard training procedures, making its direct application to downstream tasks both difficult and costly. In this work, we aim to address the above challenges within the context of document image classification by substituting real private data with a synthetic counterpart. In particular, we propose to use conditional latent diffusion models (LDMs) in combination with differential privacy (DP) to generate class-specific synthetic document images under strict privacy constraints, which can then be utilized to train a downstream classifier following standard training procedures. We investigate our approach under various pretraining setups, including unconditional, class-conditional, and layout-conditional pretraining, in combination with multiple private training strategies such as class-conditional and per-label private fine-tuning with DPDM and DP-Promise algorithms. Additionally, we evaluate it on two well-known document benchmark datasets, RVL-CDIP and Tobacco3482, and show that it can generate useful and realistic document samples across various document types and privacy levels ($\varepsilon \in \{1, 5, 10\}$). Lastly, we show that our approach achieves substantial performance improvements in downstream evaluations on small-scale datasets, compared to the direct application of DP-Adam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDAR 2025</p></details> |

Utility Control for AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead, NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation, using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of tasks without requiring a lot of changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangle Identity, Cooperate Emotion: Correlation-Aware Emotional Talking Portrait Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18087v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Talking Head Generation (THG) have achieved impressive lip synchronization and visual quality through diffusion models; yet existing methods struggle to generate emotionally expressive portraits while preserving speaker identity. We identify three critical limitations in current emotional talking head generation: insufficient utilization of audio's inherent emotional cues, identity leakage in emotion representations, and isolated learning of emotion correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework dubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion, and then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics. First, we develop a disentangled emotion embedder that jointly models audio-visual emotional cues through cross-modal attention, representing emotions as identity-agnostic Gaussian distributions. Second, we introduce a correlation-enhanced emotion conditioning module with learnable Emotion Banks that explicitly capture inter-emotion relationships through vector quantization and attention-based feature aggregation. Third, we design an emotion discrimination objective that enforces affective consistency during the diffusion process through latent-space classification. Extensive experiments on MEAD and HDTF datasets demonstrate our method's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in emotion accuracy while maintaining competitive lip-sync performance. Qualitative results and user studies further confirm our method's ability to generate identity-preserving portraits with rich, correlated emotional expressions that naturally adapt to unseen identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'25. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.03270</p></details> |
| **[From Pixels to Pathology: Restoration Diffusion for Diagnostic-Consistent Virtual IHC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02528v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing OOD Detection Using Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16525v4)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios, enabling the identification of unknown samples or objects. A prominent approach to enhance OOD detection performance involves leveraging auxiliary datasets for training. Recent efforts have explored using generative models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to synthesize outlier data in the pixel space. However, synthesizing OOD data in the pixel space can lead to reduced robustness due to over-generation. To address this challenge, we propose Outlier-Aware Learning (OAL), a novel framework that generates synthetic OOD training data within the latent space, taking a further step to study how to utilize Stable Diffusion for developing a latent-based outlier synthesis approach. This improvement facilitates network training with fewer outliers and less computational cost. Besides, to regularize the model's decision boundary, we develop a mutual information-based contrastive learning module (MICL) that amplifies the distinction between In-Distribution (ID) and collected OOD data. Moreover, we develop a knowledge distillation module to prevent the degradation of ID classification accuracy when training with OOD data. The superior performance of our method on several benchmark datasets demonstrates its efficiency and effectiveness. Source code is available in https://github.com/HengGao12/OAL.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01292v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimum Data, Maximum Impact: 20 annotated samples for explainable lung nodule classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00639v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs. However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of explainable models in medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at iMIMIC - Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image Computing workshop MICCAI 2025 Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention</p></details> |

Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025.

| **[Sheaf Graph Neural Networks via PAC-Bayes Spectral Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00357v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and demonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via end-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified confidence intervals on unseen nodes.</p></details> |  |

The analy- sis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  |

However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case subgroup performance.

However, existing MU methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> | 23 pages |

The majority of existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ICML 2025 Workshop on Reliable and Responsible Foundation Models</p></details> |

We introduce Clustering via Diffusion (CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision on the validation set. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from 78\% to 93\% when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, published in Computer and Decision Making - An International Journal (COMDEM)</p></details> |

However, their performance degrades under challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions, and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process. Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal conditions.</p></details> | 19 pages, conference |
| **[Generative Pre-training for Subjective Tasks: A Diffusion Transformer-Based Framework for Facial Beauty Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20363v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification (e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP, sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for subjective visual tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDB: Diffusion Driven Balancing to Address Spurious Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17226v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) perform well when both training and test data come from the same domain, but they often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a Diffusion Driven Balancing (DDB) technique to generate training samples with text-to-image diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples in which this correlation does not exist. Our experiments show that across different benchmarks, our technique achieves better worst-group accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ArianYp/DDB.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of data and the class imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data, contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods, constrained by inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual $\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations, this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification, image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong advantages in unseen categories.</p></details> |  |

To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Generating Adversarial Point Clouds Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21163v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models, such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models, researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However, most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added to the point cloud.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational inference for pile-up removal at hadron colliders with diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22074v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel method for pile-up removal of $pp$ interactions using variational inference with diffusion models, called vipr. Instead of using classification methods to identify which particles are from the primary collision, a generative model is trained to predict the constituents of the hard-scatter particle jets with pile-up removed. This results in an estimate of the full posterior over hard-scatter jet constituents, which has not yet been explored in the context of pile-up removal, yielding a clear advantage over existing methods especially in the presence of imperfect detector efficiency. We evaluate the performance of vipr in a sample of jets from simulated $t\bar{t}$ events overlain with pile-up contamination. vipr outperforms softdrop and has comparable performance to puppiml in predicting the substructure of the hard-scatter jets over a wide range of pile-up scenarios.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging. It may pave the way for more accessible and cost-effective advanced diagnostic tools.

| **[ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a generative approach based on denoising diffusion models (DMs) to synthesize parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Extending the recent diffusion model pipeline of F\"urrutter et al.

We demonstrate our approach in synthesizing PQCs optimized for generating high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and achieving high accuracy in quantum machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting the versatility and computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods.

We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The dynamics of the system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. GNNs with ACMP achieve state of the art performance for real-world node classification tasks on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

However, its lack of local inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization, a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically, the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA) module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for addressing ECG noise, relying on artifact classification or denoising, are constrained by annotation inconsistencies and poor generalizability. Here, we address these limitations by reframing ECG noise quantification as an anomaly detection task. We propose a diffusion-based framework trained to model the normative distribution of clean ECG signals, identifying deviations as noise without requiring explicit artifact labels. To robustly evaluate performance and mitigate label inconsistencies, we introduce a distribution-based metric using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$). Our model achieved a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308, outperforming the next-best method by over 48\%. External validation confirmed strong generalizability, facilitating the exclusion of noisy segments to improve diagnostic accuracy and support timely clinical intervention. This approach enhances real-time ECG monitoring and broadens ECG applicability in digital health technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript contains 17 pages, 10 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |

We propose RoadFusion, a framework that addresses these limitations through synthetic anomaly generation with dual-path feature adaptation. A latent diffusion model synthesizes diverse, realistic defects using text prompts and spatial masks, enabling effective training under data scarcity. Two separate feature adaptors specialize representations for normal and anomalous inputs, improving robustness to domain shift and defect variability. A lightweight discriminator learns to distinguish fine-grained defect patterns at the patch level. Evaluated on six benchmark datasets, RoadFusion achieves consistently strong performance across both classification and localization tasks, setting new state-of-the-art in multiple metrics relevant to real-world road inspection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with Diffusion Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15216v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending generative models. However, generative models perform better in image generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes will be released soon in public.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReDiSC: A Reparameterized Masked Diffusion Model for Scalable Node Classification with Structured Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14484v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved unprecedented successes in node classification tasks. Although GNNs inherently encode specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation, and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label-Consistent Dataset Distillation with Detector-Guided Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13074v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

To curb the spread of harmful content and promote the dissemination of reliable information, research on cascade graph mining has attracted increasing attention. A promising approach in this area is Contrastive Cascade Graph Learning (CCGL). One important task in cascade graph mining is cascade classification, which involves categorizing cascade graphs based on their structural characteristics. Although CCGL is expected to be effective for this task, its performance has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CCGL for cascade classification.

To address this issue, we propose WaFusion, a novel framework combining wavelet decomposition and diffusion models to generate high-quality, realistic morphed face images efficiently.

Experiments conducted on FERET, FRGC, FRLL, and WVU Twin datasets demonstrate WaFusion's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, producing high-resolution morphs with fewer artifacts. Our framework excels across key biometric metrics, including the Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER), Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER), and Equal Error Rate (EER).

Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia) and amyloid status classification. Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of 95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model predictions. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited biomedical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Data Synthesis Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07426v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable machine learning and statistical analysis rely on diverse, well-distributed training data. However, real-world datasets are often limited in size and exhibit underrepresentation across key subpopulations, leading to biased predictions and reduced performance, particularly in supervised tasks such as classification. To address these challenges, we propose Conditional Data Synthesis Augmentation (CoDSA), a novel framework that leverages generative models, such as diffusion models, to synthesize high-fidelity data for improving model performance across multimodal domains including tabular, textual, and image data. CoDSA generates synthetic samples that faithfully capture the conditional distributions of the original data, with a focus on under-sampled or high-interest regions. Through transfer learning, CoDSA fine-tunes pre-trained generative models to enhance the realism of synthetic data and increase sample density in sparse areas. This process preserves inter-modal relationships, mitigates data imbalance, improves domain adaptation, and boosts generalization. We also introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the statistical accuracy improvements enabled by CoDSA as a function of synthetic sample volume and targeted region allocation, providing formal guarantees of its effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDSA consistently outperforms non-adaptive augmentation strategies and state-of-the-art baselines in both supervised and unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |

While several anomaly synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies, enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks, while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and classification.</p></details> |  |

Streamline-based registration approaches can leverage the 3D geometric information of fiber pathways to enable spatial alignment after registration. Existing methods usually rely on the optimization of the spatial distances to identify the optimal transformation. However, such methods overlook point connectivity patterns within the streamline itself, limiting their ability to identify anatomical correspondences across tractography datasets. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised approach using deep learning to perform streamline-based dMRI tractography registration. The overall idea is to identify corresponding keypoint pairs across subjects for spatial alignment of tractography datasets. We model tractography as point clouds to leverage the graph connectivity along streamlines. We propose a novel keypoint detection method for streamlines, framed as a probabilistic classification task to identify anatomically consistent correspondences across unstructured streamline sets. In the experiments, we compare several existing methods and show highly effective and efficient tractography registration performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Enhancement to Understanding: Build a Generalized Bridge for Low-light Vision via Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08380v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding, constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding, which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF). Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[ScoreAdv: Score-based Targeted Generation of Natural Adversarial Examples via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06078v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform, which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically, the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components. During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation. Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and (3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000 paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach. Code and pre-trained models are publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

A challenge, however, is the effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance. Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 7 Figures |

However, these models also blur the difference between real images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot synthetic image detection tasks.

One potential solution is to generate synthetic images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy. However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to 78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations, enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and facilitating medical diagnosis and research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Parameterized Diffusion Optimization enabled Autoregressive Ordinal Regression for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04978v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care. Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However, there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step. Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Qinkaiyu/AOR-DR.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Although these models have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation, which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the representations to regress positional information of the patches from high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (Early Access Available) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989734</p></details> |
| **[On the Trade-off between Flatness and Optimization in Distributed Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20006v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a theoretical framework to evaluate and compare the performance of stochastic gradient algorithms for distributed learning in relation to their behavior around local minima in nonconvex environments. Previous works have noticed that convergence toward flat local minima tend to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms. This work discovers three interesting results. First, it shows that decentralized learning strategies are able to escape faster away from local minima and favor convergence toward flatter minima relative to the centralized solution. Second, in decentralized methods, the consensus strategy has a worse excess-risk performance than diffusion, giving it a better chance of escaping from local minima and favoring flatter minima. Third, and importantly, the ultimate classification accuracy is not solely dependent on the flatness of the local minimum but also on how well a learning algorithm can approach that minimum. In other words, the classification accuracy is a function of both flatness and optimization performance. In this regard, since diffusion has a lower excess-risk than consensus, when both algorithms are trained starting from random initial points, diffusion enhances the classification accuracy. The paper examines the interplay between the two measures of flatness and optimization error closely. One important conclusion is that decentralized strategies deliver in general enhanced classification accuracy because they strike a more favorable balance between flatness and optimization performance compared to the centralized solution.</p></details> |  |

While much research has focused on zero-shot learning in computer vision, the application of these methods to environmental audio remains underexplored, with poor performance in existing studies. Generative methods, which have demonstrated success in computer vision, are notably absent from zero-shot environmental sound classification studies. To address this gap, this work investigates generative methods for zero-shot learning in environmental audio. Two successful generative models from computer vision are adapted: a cross-aligned and distribution-aligned variational autoencoder (CADA-VAE) and a leveraging invariant side generative adversarial network (LisGAN). Additionally, we introduced a novel diffusion model conditioned on class auxiliary data. Synthetic embeddings generated by the diffusion model are combined with seen class embeddings to train a classifier. Experiments are conducted on five environmental audio datasets, ESC-50, ARCA23K-FSD, FSC22, UrbanSound8k and TAU Urban Acoustics 2019, and one music classification dataset, GTZAN. Results show that the diffusion model outperforms all baseline methods on average across six audio datasets. This work establishes the diffusion model as a promising approach for zero-shot learning and introduces the first benchmark of generative methods for zero-shot environmental sound classification, providing a foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

Obtaining data to train robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for species classification can be challenging, particularly for rare species. Data augmentation can boost classification accuracy by increasing the diversity of training data and is cheaper to obtain than expert-labelled data. However, many classic image-based augmentation techniques are not suitable for audio spectrograms. 2. We investigate two generative AI models as data augmentation tools to synthesise spectrograms and supplement audio data: Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The latter performed particularly well in terms of both realism of generated spectrograms and accuracy in a resulting classification task. 3. Alongside these new approaches, we present a new audio data set of 640 hours of bird calls from wind farm sites in Ireland, approximately 800 samples of which have been labelled by experts. Wind farm data are particularly challenging for classification models given the background wind and turbine noise. 4. Training an ensemble of classification models on real and synthetic data combined gave 92.6% accuracy (and 90.5% with just the real data) when compared with highly confident BirdNET predictions. 5. Our approach can be used to augment acoustic signals for more species and other land-use types, and has the potential to bring about a step-change in our capacity to develop reliable AI-based detection of rare species.

| **[Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Disambiguation Models for Partial Label Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00411v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from ambiguous labels is a long-standing problem in practical machine learning applications. The purpose of \emph{partial label learning} (PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process. Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Representation Consistency Model via Contrastive Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13094v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average.

This work implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, KI2025 - 48th German Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

| **[AI-Augmented Thyroid Scintigraphy for Robust Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00366v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Thyroid scintigraphy plays a vital role in diagnosing a range of thyroid disorders. While deep learning classification models hold significant promise in this domain, their effectiveness is frequently compromised by limited and imbalanced datasets. This study investigates the impact of three data augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a ResNet18 classifier. Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine medical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID). Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context. O+FM+CA yielded the most balanced and robust performance across all classes. Conclusion: Integrating FM and clinically-informed SD augmentation, especially when guided by expert prompts, substantially improves thyroid scintigraphy classification. These findings highlight the importance of leveraging both structured medical input and advanced generative models for more effective training on limited datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

One research focus is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs. However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.

Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025.

However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case subgroup performance.

However, the scarcity of data and the class imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data, contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-ray2CTPA: Leveraging Diffusion Models to Enhance Pulmonary Embolism Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16109v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest X-rays or chest radiography (CXR), commonly used for medical diagnostics, typically enables limited imaging compared to computed tomography (CT) scans, which offer more detailed and accurate three-dimensional data, particularly contrast-enhanced scans like CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA). However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging. It may pave the way for more accessible and cost-effective advanced diagnostic tools.

One potential solution is to generate synthetic images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy. However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to 78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations, enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and facilitating medical diagnosis and research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

| **[Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features for Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23460v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2025</p></details> |

Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</p></details> |

This study focuses on a neuroimaging prediction framework based on both structural and functional neuroimaging data. We propose a next-generation prediction model, \textbf{MultiViT2}, which combines a pretrained representative learning base model with a vision transformer backbone for prediction output. Additionally, we developed a data augmentation module based on the latent diffusion model that enriches input data by generating augmented neuroimaging samples, thereby enhancing predictive performance through reduced overfitting and improved generalizability. We show that MultiViT2 significantly outperforms the first-generation model in schizophrenia classification accuracy and demonstrates strong scalability and portability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Doctor Approved: Generating Medically Accurate Skin Disease Images through AI-Expert Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12323v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.</p></details> |  |

However, existing resources may lack the diversity and accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other areas of medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool for medical AI applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion bridge model for 3D brain image translation between T1w MRI and DTI modalities. Our model learns to generate high-quality DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) images from T1w images and vice versa, enabling cross-modality data augmentation and reducing the need for extensive DTI acquisition. We evaluate our approach using perceptual similarity, pixel-level agreement, and distributional consistency metrics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing anatomical structures and preserving information on white matter integrity. The practical utility of the synthetic data is validated through sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks, where the generated images achieve comparable performance to real data. Our diffusion bridge model offers a promising solution for improving neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical decision-making, with the potential to significantly impact neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels.

However, current research on optimization algorithms in federated learning often focuses on limited datasets and scenarios, primarily centered around natural images, with insufficient comparative experiments in medical contexts. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms in the context of medical imaging. We conduct a fair comparison of classification models trained using various federated learning algorithms across multiple medical imaging datasets. Additionally, we evaluate system performance metrics, such as communication cost and computational efficiency, while considering different federated learning architectures. Our findings show that medical imaging datasets pose substantial challenges for current federated learning optimization algorithms. No single algorithm consistently delivers optimal performance across all medical federated learning scenarios, and many optimization algorithms may underperform when applied to these datasets. Our experiments provide a benchmark and guidance for future research and application of federated learning in medical imaging contexts. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and robust method that combines generative techniques using denoising diffusion probabilistic models with label smoothing to augment datasets, widely enhancing the performance of federated learning on classification tasks across various medical imaging datasets. Our code will be released on GitHub, offering a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for future federated learning studies in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

However, the challenge of noisy labels and limited high-quality datasets remains underexplored. To address this, we establish the first benchmark for noisy labels in Med-VQA by simulating human mislabeling with semantically designed noise types. More importantly, we introduce the DiN framework, which leverages a diffusion model to handle noisy labels in Med-VQA. Unlike the dominant classification-based VQA approaches that directly predict answers, our Answer Diffuser (AD) module employs a coarse-to-fine process, refining answer candidates with a diffusion model for improved accuracy. The Answer Condition Generator (ACG) further enhances this process by generating task-specific conditional information via integrating answer embeddings with fused image-question features. To address label noise, our Noisy Label Refinement(NLR) module introduces a robust loss function and dynamic answer adjustment to further boost the performance of the AD module.</p></details> |  |

OSFL requires only a single round of client data or model upload, which reduces communication costs and mitigates privacy threats compared to traditional FL. Despite these promising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data heterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL systems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on large-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these issues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results in significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance degradation in classification models trained on such data. This issue is particularly pronounced in rare domains, such as medical imaging, which are underrepresented in LDM's pretraining data. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the pretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP synthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without compromising the privacy regulations. FedBiP is also the first approach to simultaneously address feature space heterogeneity and client data scarcity in OSFL. Our method is validated through extensive experiments on three OSFL benchmarks with feature space heterogeneity, as well as on challenging medical and satellite image datasets with label heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiP, which substantially outperforms other OSFL methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications.

| **[Explainable, Multi-modal Wound Infection Classification from Images Augmented with Generated Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20277v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infections in Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) can cause severe complications, including tissue death and limb amputation, highlighting the need for accurate, timely diagnosis. Previous machine learning methods have focused on identifying infections by analyzing wound images alone, without utilizing additional metadata such as medical notes. In this study, we aim to improve infection detection by introducing Synthetic Caption Augmented Retrieval for Wound Infection Detection (SCARWID), a novel deep learning framework that leverages synthetic textual descriptions to augment DFU images. SCARWID consists of two components: (1) Wound-BLIP, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on GPT-4o-generated descriptions to synthesize consistent captions from images; and (2) an Image-Text Fusion module that uses cross-attention to extract cross-modal embeddings from an image and its corresponding Wound-BLIP caption. Infection status is determined by retrieving the top-k similar items from a labeled support set. To enhance the diversity of training data, we utilized a latent diffusion model to generate additional wound images. As a result, SCARWID outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively, for wound infection classification. Displaying the generated captions alongside the wound images and infection detection results enhances interpretability and trust, enabling nurses to align SCARWID outputs with their medical knowledge. This is particularly valuable when wound notes are unavailable or when assisting novice nurses who may find it difficult to identify visual attributes of wound infection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Polyp Detection and Diagnosis through Compositional Prompt-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17951v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern, and early detection through screening plays a critical role in reducing mortality. While deep learning models have shown promise in improving polyp detection, classification, and segmentation, their generalization across diverse clinical environments, particularly with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, remains a challenge. Multi-center datasets like PolypGen have been developed to address these issues, but their collection is costly and time-consuming. Traditional data augmentation techniques provide limited variability, failing to capture the complexity of medical images. Diffusion models have emerged as a promising solution for generating synthetic polyp images, but the image generation process in current models mainly relies on segmentation masks as the condition, limiting their ability to capture the full clinical context. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Progressive Spectrum Diffusion Model (PSDM) that integrates diverse clinical annotations-such as segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and colonoscopy reports-by transforming them into compositional prompts. These prompts are organized into coarse and fine components, allowing the model to capture both broad spatial structures and fine details, generating clinically accurate synthetic images. By augmenting training data with PSDM-generated samples, our model significantly improves polyp detection, classification, and segmentation. For instance, on the PolypGen dataset, PSDM increases the F1 score by 2.12% and the mean average precision by 3.09%, demonstrating superior performance in OOD scenarios and enhanced generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Medical Vision-Language Pre-training Succeed with Purely Synthetic Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13523v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP) has made significant progress in enabling zero-shot tasks for medical image understanding. However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: "Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?" To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained exclusively on synthetic data outperform those trained on real data by 3.8% in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of 9.07%. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.</p></details> | Under Review |

Morphological factors such as size, location, texture, and variable appearance complicate tumor inspection. Medical imaging presents challenges, including noise and incomplete images. This research article presents a methodology for processing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, encompassing techniques for image classification and denoising. The effective use of MRI images allows medical professionals to detect brain disorders, including tumors. This research aims to categorize healthy brain tissue and brain tumors by analyzing the provided MRI data. Unlike alternative methods like Computed Tomography (CT), MRI technology offers a more detailed representation of internal anatomical components, making it a suitable option for studying data related to brain tumors. The MRI picture is first subjected to a denoising technique utilizing an Anisotropic diffusion filter. The dataset utilized for the models creation is a publicly accessible and validated Brain Tumour Classification (MRI) database, comprising 3,264 brain MRI scans. SMOTE was employed for data augmentation and dataset balancing. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) such as ResNet152V2, VGG, ViT, and EfficientNet were employed for the classification procedure. EfficientNet attained an accuracy of 98%, the highest recorded.</p></details> |  |

However, the creation of high-quality annotated datasets for training remains a major challenge. This study introduces a novel single-stage approach (HistoSmith) for generating image-label pairs to augment histology datasets. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with separate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a latent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts, classification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data generation by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types, quantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset and the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and diverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell instance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented cell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultrasound Image Generation using Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08580v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models for image generation have been a subject of increasing interest due to their ability to generate diverse, high-quality images. Image generation has immense potential in medical imaging because open-source medical images are difficult to obtain compared to natural images, especially for rare conditions. The generated images can be used later to train classification and segmentation models. In this paper, we propose simulating realistic ultrasound (US) images by successive fine-tuning of large diffusion models on different publicly available databases. To do so, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, on BUSI (Breast US Images) an ultrasound breast image dataset. We successfully generated high-quality US images of the breast using simple prompts that specify the organ and pathology, which appeared realistic to three experienced US scientists and a US radiologist. Additionally, we provided user control by conditioning the model with segmentations through ControlNet. We will release the source code at http://code.sonography.ai/ to allow fast US image generation to the scientific community.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages conference paper for SPIE medical imaging</p></details> |
| **[Diverse Image Generation with Diffusion Models and Cross Class Label Learning for Polyp Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05444v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologic diagnosis is a critical phase in deciding the optimal treatment procedure for dealing with colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

However, as the text to nature image models, we show that the T2MedI model can also bias to some subgroups to overlook the minority ones in the training set. In this work, we first build a T2MedI model based on the pre-trained Imagen model, which has the fixed contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) text encoder, while its decoder has been fine-tuned on medical images from the Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset. Its gender bias is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Toward this issue, we propose to fine-tune the T2MedI toward the target application dataset to align their sensitive subgroups distribution probability. Specifically, the alignment loss for fine-tuning is guided by an off-the-shelf sensitivity-subgroup classifier to match the classification probability between the generated images and the expected target dataset. In addition, the image quality is maintained by a CLIP-consistency regularization term following a knowledge distillation scheme. For evaluation, we set the target dataset to be enhanced as the BraST18 dataset, and trained a brain magnetic resonance (MR) slice-based gender classifier from it. With our method, the generated MR image can markedly reduce the inconsistency with the gender proportion in the BraTS18 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

However, manual assessments are subjective and prone to variability. In response, we introduce FDDM, a novel framework bridging the gap between patch classification and region-based segmentation. FDDM operates in two stages: patch-based classification, followed by region-based refinement, enabling cross-patch information intergation. Leveraging a newly curated dataset of osteosarcoma images, FDDM demonstrates superior segmentation performance, achieving up to a 10% improvement mIOU and a 32.12% enhancement in necrosis rate estimation over state-of-the-art methods. This framework sets a new benchmark in osteosarcoma assessment, highlighting the potential of foundation models and diffusion-based refinements in complex medical imaging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

Diffusion models, a recent generative modeling technique, offer a potential solution by generating synthetic and realistic data. However, questions remain about the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on original and synthetic datasets. If diffusion-generated samples can help CNN models perform comparably to those trained on original datasets, reliance on patient-specific data for training CNNs might be reduced. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of diffusion models for generating synthetic medical images to train CNNs in three domains: Brain Tumor MRI, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), and SARS-CoV-2 CT scans. A diffusion model was trained to generate synthetic datasets for each domain. Pre-trained CNN architectures were then trained on these synthetic datasets and evaluated on unseen real data. All three datasets achieved promising classification performance using CNNs trained on synthetic data. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) analysis revealed that the models focused on relevant image features for classification. This study demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to generate synthetic medical images for training CNNs in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this study explores the use of generative models, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Progressive Growing Generative Adversarial Networks (PGGANs), for dataset augmentation. The research introduces a framework to assess the impact of synthetic images generated by DDPM and PGGANs on the performance of four models: a custom CNN, Untrained VGG16, Pretrained VGG16, and Pretrained ResNet50. Experiments were conducted using Random Sampling and Greedy K Sampling to create small, imbalanced datasets. The synthetic images were evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and compared to original datasets through classification metrics. The results show that DDPM consistently generated more realistic images with lower FID scores and significantly outperformed PGGANs in improving classification metrics across all models and datasets. Incorporating DDPM-generated images into the original datasets increased accuracy by up to 6%, enhancing model robustness and stability, particularly in imbalanced scenarios. Random Sampling demonstrated superior stability, while Greedy K Sampling offered diversity at the cost of higher FID scores. This study highlights the efficacy of DDPM in augmenting small, imbalanced medical image datasets, improving model performance by balancing the dataset and expanding its size.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAug: Diffusion-based Channel Augmentation for Radiology Image Retrieval and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04828v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image understanding requires meticulous examination of fine visual details, with particular regions requiring additional attention. While radiologists build such expertise over years of experience, it is challenging for AI models to learn where to look with limited amounts of training data. This limitation results in unsatisfying robustness in medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion-based Feature Augmentation (DAug), a portable method that improves a perception model's performance with a generative model's output. Specifically, we extend a radiology image to multiple channels, with the additional channels being the heatmaps of regions where diseases tend to develop. A diffusion-based image-to-image translation model was used to generate such heatmaps conditioned on selected disease classes. Our method is motivated by the fact that generative models learn the distribution of normal and abnormal images, and such knowledge is complementary to image understanding tasks. In addition, we propose the Image-Text-Class Hybrid Contrastive learning to utilize both text and class labels. With two novel approaches combined, our method surpasses baseline models without changing the model architecture, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both medical image retrieval and classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CytoDiffusion, a diffusion-based classifier that effectively models blood cell morphology, combining accurate classification with robust anomaly detection, resistance to distributional shifts, interpretability, data efficiency, and superhuman uncertainty quantification. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative models in anomaly detection (AUC 0.990 vs. 0.918), resistance to domain shifts (85.85% vs. 74.38% balanced accuracy), and performance in low-data regimes (95.88% vs. 94.95% balanced accuracy). Notably, our model generates synthetic blood cell images that are nearly indistinguishable from real images, as demonstrated by an authenticity test in which expert haematologists achieved only 52.3% accuracy (95% CI: [50.5%, 54.2%]) in distinguishing real from generated images. Furthermore, we enhance model explainability through the generation of directly interpretable counterfactual heatmaps. Our comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing these multiple performance dimensions, establishes a new benchmark for medical image analysis in haematology, ultimately enabling improved diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.

This paper introduces Diffusion-Driven Diagnosis (D-Cube), a novel approach that leverages hyper-features from a diffusion model combined with contrastive learning to improve cancer diagnosis. D-Cube employs advanced feature selection techniques that utilize the robust representational capabilities of diffusion models, enhancing classification performance on medical datasets under challenging conditions such as data imbalance and limited sample availability. The feature selection process optimizes the extraction of clinically relevant features, significantly improving classification accuracy and demonstrating resilience in imbalanced and limited data scenarios. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of D-Cube across multiple medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and X-ray, showing superior performance compared to existing baseline models. D-Cube represents a new strategy in cancer detection, employing advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

This is especially problematic in medical settings, where biased models fail when applied to different hospitals or systems. In such cases, data-driven methods to reduce spurious correlations are preferred, as clinicians can directly validate the modified images. While Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Diffusion Models) show promise for natural images, they are impractical for medical use due to the difficulty of describing spurious medical features. To address this, we propose Masked Medical Image Inpainting (MaskMedPaint), which uses text-to-image diffusion models to augment training images by inpainting areas outside key classification regions to match the target domain. We demonstrate that MaskMedPaint enhances generalization to target domains across both natural (Waterbirds, iWildCam) and medical (ISIC 2018, Chest X-ray) datasets, given limited unlabeled target images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 12 pages</p></details> |

The medical imaging domain faces unique challenges due to scarce data labelling -- insufficient for standard training, and critical nature of the applications that require high performance, confidence, and explainability of the models. In this work, we propose to tackle those challenges with a single model that combines standard classification with a diffusion-based generative task in a single shared parametrisation. By sharing representations, our model effectively learns from both labeled and unlabeled data while at the same time providing accurate explanations through counterfactual examples. In our experiments, we show that our Mediffusion achieves results comparable to recent semi-supervised methods while providing more reliable and precise explanations.</p></details> |  |

Predominant methodologies in this domain have primarily focused on the direct prediction of glaucoma stage labels from longitudinal datasets. However, such methods may not adequately encapsulate the nuanced developmental trajectory of the disease. To enhance the diagnostic acumen of medical practitioners, we propose a novel diffusion-based model to predict prospective images by extrapolating from existing longitudinal fundus images of patients. The methodology delineated in this study distinctively leverages sequences of images as inputs. Subsequently, a time-aligned mask is employed to select a specific year for image generation. During the training phase, the time-aligned mask resolves the issue of irregular temporal intervals in longitudinal image sequence sampling. Additionally, we utilize a strategy of randomly masking a frame in the sequence to establish the ground truth. This methodology aids the network in continuously acquiring knowledge regarding the internal relationships among the sequences throughout the learning phase. Moreover, the introduction of textual labels is instrumental in categorizing images generated within the sequence. The empirical findings from the conducted experiments indicate that our proposed model not only effectively generates longitudinal data but also significantly improves the precision of downstream classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BIBM 2024</p></details> |

Although current medical TTI methods have made some progress in report-to-Chest-Xray (CXR) generation, their generation performance may be limited due to the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel disease-knowledge enhanced Diffusion-based TTI learning framework, named Diff-CXR, for medical report-to-CXR generation. First, to minimize the negative impacts of noisy data on generation, we devise a Latent Noise Filtering Strategy that gradually learns the general patterns of anomalies and removes them in the latent space. Then, an Adaptive Vision-Aware Textual Learning Strategy is designed to learn concise and important report embeddings in a domain-specific Vision-Language Model, providing textual guidance for Chest-Xray generation. Finally, by incorporating the general disease knowledge into the pretrained TTI model via a delicate control adapter, a disease-knowledge enhanced diffusion model is introduced to achieve realistic and precise report-to-CXR generation. Experimentally, our Diff-CXR outperforms previous SOTA medical TTI methods by 33.4\% / 8.0\% and 23.8\% / 56.4\% in the FID and mAUC score on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray, with the lowest computational complexity at 29.641 GFLOPs. Downstream experiments on three thorax disease classification benchmarks and one CXR-report generation benchmark demonstrate that Diff-CXR is effective in improving classical CXR analysis methods. Notably, models trained on the combination of 1\% real data and synthetic data can achieve a competitive mAUC score compared to models trained on all data, presenting promising clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Common CE approaches require an additional model and are typically constrained to binary counterfactuals. In contrast, we propose a novel method that operates directly on the latent space of a generative model, specifically a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE). This approach offers inherent interpretability by enabling the generation of CEs and the continuous visualization of the model's internal representation across decision boundaries. Our method leverages the DAE's ability to encode images into a semantically rich latent space in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled data or separate feature extraction models. We show that these latent representations are helpful for medical condition classification and the ordinal regression of severity pathologies, such as vertebral compression fractures (VCF) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Beyond binary CEs, our method supports the visualization of ordinal CEs using a linear model, providing deeper insights into the model's decision-making process and enhancing interpretability. Experiments across various medical imaging datasets demonstrate the method's advantages in interpretability and versatility. The linear manifold of the DAE's latent space allows for meaningful interpolation and manipulation, making it a powerful tool for exploring medical image properties.

| **[RadGazeGen: Radiomics and Gaze-guided Medical Image Generation using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00307v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present RadGazeGen, a novel framework for integrating experts' eye gaze patterns and radiomic feature maps as controls to text-to-image diffusion models for high fidelity medical image generation. Despite the recent success of text-to-image diffusion models, text descriptions are often found to be inadequate and fail to convey detailed disease-specific information to these models to generate clinically accurate images. The anatomy, disease texture patterns, and location of the disease are extremely important to generate realistic images; moreover the fidelity of image generation can have significant implications in downstream tasks involving disease diagnosis or treatment repose assessment. Hence, there is a growing need to carefully define the controls used in diffusion models for medical image generation. Eye gaze patterns of radiologists are important visuo-cognitive information, indicative of subtle disease patterns and spatial location. Radiomic features further provide important subvisual cues regarding disease phenotype. In this work, we propose to use these gaze patterns in combination with standard radiomics descriptors, as controls, to generate anatomically correct and disease-aware medical images. RadGazeGen is evaluated for image generation quality and diversity on the REFLACX dataset. To demonstrate clinical applicability, we also show classification performance on the generated images from the CheXpert test set (n=500) and long-tailed learning performance on the MIMIC-CXR-LT test set (n=23550).</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Imbalanced Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14313v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data often has a long-tailed distribution, where the scarcity of tail samples significantly limits the model's generalization ability. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are generative models based on stochastic differential equation theory and have demonstrated impressive performance in image classification tasks. However, existing diffusion probabilistic models do not perform satisfactorily in classifying tail classes. In this work, we propose the Anisotropic Diffusion Probabilistic Model (ADPM) for imbalanced image classification problems. We utilize the data distribution to control the diffusion speed of different class samples during the forward process, effectively improving the classification accuracy of the denoiser in the reverse process. Specifically, we provide a theoretical strategy for selecting noise levels for different categories in the diffusion process based on error analysis theory to address the imbalanced classification problem. Furthermore, we integrate global and local image prior in the forward process to enhance the model's discriminative ability in the spatial dimension, while incorporate semantic-level contextual information in the reverse process to boost the model's discriminative power and robustness. Through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on four medical benchmark datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling long-tail data. Our results confirm that the anisotropic diffusion model significantly improves the classification accuracy of rare classes while maintaining the accuracy of head classes. On the skin lesion datasets, PAD-UFES and HAM10000, the F1-scores of our method improved by 4% and 3%, respectively compared to the original diffusion probabilistic model.</p></details> |  |

While inference with these systems on consumer-grade GPUs is increasingly feasible, training from scratch requires large captioned datasets and significant computational resources. In medical image generation, the limited availability of large, publicly accessible datasets with text reports poses challenges due to legal and ethical concerns. This work shows that adapting pre-trained Stable Diffusion models to medical imaging modalities is achievable by training text embeddings using Textual Inversion. In this study, we experimented with small medical datasets (100 samples each from three modalities) and trained within hours to generate diagnostically accurate images, as judged by an expert radiologist. Experiments with Textual Inversion training and inference parameters reveal the necessity of larger embeddings and more examples in the medical domain. Classification experiments show an increase in diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, from 0.78 to 0.80. Further experiments demonstrate embedding flexibility through disease interpolation, combining pathologies, and inpainting for precise disease appearance control. The trained embeddings are compact (less than 1 MB), enabling easy data sharing with reduced privacy concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MIDL 2024</p></details> |

This distribution presents a significant challenge because rare conditions are critical to detect and difficult to classify due to limited data. In this paper, rather than attempting to classify rare classes, we aim to detect these as out-of-distribution data reliably. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem. We significantly improve the OOD detection performance on a challenging histopathological task with only ten samples per tail class without losing classification accuracy on the head classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving EEG Classification Through Randomly Reassembling Original and Generated Data with Transformer-based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20253v2)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has been widely used in various medical and engineering applications, where it is important for understanding brain function, diagnosing diseases, and assessing mental health conditions. However, the scarcity of EEG data severely restricts the performance of EEG classification networks, and generative model-based data augmentation methods have emerged as potential solutions to overcome this challenge. There are two problems with existing methods: (1) The quality of the generated EEG signals is not high; (2) The enhancement of EEG classification networks is not effective. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a generated data-based augmentation method to address the above two problems. For the characteristics of EEG signals, we propose a constant-factor scaling method to preprocess the signals, which reduces the loss of information. We incorporated Multi-Scale Convolution and Dynamic Fourier Spectrum Information modules into the model, improving the stability of the training process and the quality of the generated data. The proposed augmentation method randomly reassemble the generated data with original data in the time-domain to obtain vicinal data, which improves the model performance by minimizing the empirical risk and the vicinal risk. We verify the proposed augmentation method on four EEG datasets for four tasks and observe significant accuracy performance improvements: 14.00% on the Bonn dataset; 6.38% on the SleepEDF-20 dataset; 9.42% on the FACED dataset; 2.5% on the Shu dataset. We will make the code of our method publicly accessible soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Evolution of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Diffusion-based Morphing Model for X-ray Medical Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00891v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that significantly affects the mobility of older adults. In the medical domain, images containing temporal data are frequently utilized to study temporal dynamics and statistically monitor disease progression. While deep learning-based generative models for natural images have been widely researched, there are comparatively few methods available for synthesizing temporal knee X-rays. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning model designed to synthesize intermediate X-ray images between a specific patient's healthy knee and severe KOA stages. During the testing phase, based on a healthy knee X-ray, the proposed model can produce a continuous and effective sequence of KOA X-ray images with varying degrees of severity. Specifically, we introduce a Diffusion-based Morphing Model by modifying the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Our approach integrates diffusion and morphing modules, enabling the model to capture spatial morphing details between source and target knee X-ray images and synthesize intermediate frames along a geodesic path. A hybrid loss consisting of diffusion loss, morphing loss, and supervision loss was employed. We demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the highest temporal frame synthesis performance, effectively augmenting data for classification models and simulating the progression of KOA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Sample Quality via the Latent Space of Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15171v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in generative models increase the need for sample quality assessment. To do so, previous methods rely on a pre-trained feature extractor to embed the generated samples and real samples into a common space for comparison. However, different feature extractors might lead to inconsistent assessment outcomes. Moreover, these methods are not applicable for domains where a robust, universal feature extractor does not yet exist, such as medical images or 3D assets. In this paper, we propose to directly examine the latent space of the trained generative model to infer generated sample quality. This is feasible because the quality a generated sample directly relates to the amount of training data resembling it, and we can infer this information by examining the density of the latent space. Accordingly, we use a latent density score function to quantify sample quality. We show that the proposed score correlates highly with the sample quality for various generative models including VAEs, GANs and Latent Diffusion Models. Compared with previous quality assessment methods, our method has the following advantages: 1) pre-generation quality estimation with reduced computational cost, 2) generalizability to various domains and modalities, and 3) applicability to latent-based image editing and generation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods can benefit downstream tasks such as few-shot image classification and latent face image editing.

| **[GenMix: Combining Generative and Mixture Data Augmentation for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20650v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique called GenMix, which combines generative and mixture approaches to leverage the strengths of both methods. While generative models excel at creating new data patterns, they face challenges such as mode collapse in GANs and difficulties in training diffusion models, especially with limited medical imaging data. On the other hand, mixture models enhance class boundary regions but tend to favor the major class in scenarios with class imbalance. To address these limitations, GenMix integrates both approaches to complement each other. GenMix operates in two stages: (1) training a generative model to produce synthetic images, and (2) performing mixup between synthetic and real data. This process improves the quality and diversity of synthetic data while simultaneously benefiting from the new pattern learning of generative models and the boundary enhancement of mixture models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) in CT images. Our results demonstrate that GenMix enhances the performance of various generative models, including DCGAN, StyleGAN, Textual Inversion, and Diffusion Models. Notably, the proposed method with Textual Inversion outperforms other methods without fine-tuning diffusion model on the FLL dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiNO-Diffusion. Scaling Medical Diffusion via Self-Supervised Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11594v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful foundation models for a variety of tasks, with a large focus in synthetic image generation. However, their requirement of large annotated datasets for training limits their applicability in medical imaging, where datasets are typically smaller and sparsely annotated. We introduce DiNO-Diffusion, a self-supervised method for training latent diffusion models (LDMs) that conditions the generation process on image embeddings extracted from DiNO. By eliminating the reliance on annotations, our training leverages over 868k unlabelled images from public chest X-Ray (CXR) datasets. Despite being self-supervised, DiNO-Diffusion shows comprehensive manifold coverage, with FID scores as low as 4.7, and emerging properties when evaluated in downstream tasks. It can be used to generate semantically-diverse synthetic datasets even from small data pools, demonstrating up to 20% AUC increase in classification performance when used for data augmentation. Images were generated with different sampling strategies over the DiNO embedding manifold and using real images as a starting point. Results suggest, DiNO-Diffusion could facilitate the creation of large datasets for flexible training of downstream AI models from limited amount of real data, while also holding potential for privacy preservation. Additionally, DiNO-Diffusion demonstrates zero-shot segmentation performance of up to 84.4% Dice score when evaluating lung lobe segmentation. This evidences good CXR image-anatomy alignment, akin to segmenting using textual descriptors on vanilla DMs. Finally, DiNO-Diffusion can be easily adapted to other medical imaging modalities or state-of-the-art diffusion models, opening the door for large-scale, multi-domain image generation pipelines for medical imaging.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Without directly comparable methods in 3D medical imaging, we benchmarked GenerateCT against cutting-edge methods, demonstrating its superiority across all key metrics. Importantly, we evaluated GenerateCT's clinical applications in a multi-abnormality classification task. First, we established a baseline by training a multi-abnormality classifier on our real dataset. To further assess the model's generalization to external data and performance with unseen prompts in a zero-shot scenario, we employed an external set to train the classifier, setting an additional benchmark. We conducted two experiments in which we doubled the training datasets by synthesizing an equal number of volumes for each set using GenerateCT. The first experiment demonstrated an 11% improvement in the AP score when training the classifier jointly on real and generated volumes. The second experiment showed a 7% improvement when training on both real and generated volumes based on unseen prompts. Moreover, GenerateCT enables the scaling of synthetic training datasets to arbitrary sizes. As an example, we generated 100,000 3D CTs, fivefold the number in our real set, and trained the classifier exclusively on these synthetic CTs. Impressively, this classifier surpassed the performance of the one trained on all available real data by a margin of 8%. Last, domain experts evaluated the generated volumes, confirming a high degree of alignment with the text prompt.

| **[Image Distillation for Safe Data Sharing in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13536v3)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology can help clinicians make accurate diagnoses, determine disease prognosis, and plan appropriate treatment strategies. As deep learning techniques prove successful in the medical domain, the primary challenges become limited data availability and concerns about data sharing and privacy. Federated learning has addressed this challenge by training models locally and updating parameters on a server. However, issues, such as domain shift and bias, persist and impact overall performance. Dataset distillation presents an alternative approach to overcoming these challenges. It involves creating a small synthetic dataset that encapsulates essential information, which can be shared without constraints. At present, this paradigm is not practicable as current distillation approaches only generate non human readable representations and exhibit insufficient performance for downstream learning tasks. We train a latent diffusion model and construct a new distilled synthetic dataset with a small number of human readable synthetic images. Selection of maximally informative synthetic images is done via graph community analysis of the representation space. We compare downstream classification models trained on our synthetic distillation data to models trained on real data and reach performances suitable for practical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Recently, the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) has shown the potential to generate high-quality images by converting Gaussian random noise into realistic images. In this paper, we apply the DPM to augment the deep ultraviolet fluorescence (DUV) image dataset with an aim to improve breast cancer classification for intraoperative margin assessment. For classification, we divide the whole surface DUV image into small patches and extract convolutional features for each patch by utilizing the pre-trained ResNet. Then, we feed them into an XGBoost classifier for patch-level decisions and then fuse them with a regional importance map computed by Grad-CAM++ for whole surface-level prediction. Our experimental results show that augmenting the training dataset with the DPM significantly improves breast cancer detection performance in DUV images, increasing accuracy from 93% to 97%, compared to using Affine transformations and ProGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2024</p></details> |

While Vision Transformer has shown superior performance over convolutional neural networks in image classification tasks, their effectiveness is often demonstrated on sufficiently large 2D datasets and they easily encounter overfitting issues on small medical image datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a Diffusion-based 3D Vision Transformer (Diff3Dformer), which utilizes the latent space of the Diffusion model to form the slice sequence for 3D analysis and incorporates clustering attention into ViT to aggregate repetitive information within 3D CT scans, thereby harnessing the power of the advanced transformer in 3D classification tasks on small datasets. Our method exhibits improved performance on two different scales of small datasets of 3D lung CT scans, surpassing the state of the art 3D methods and other transformer-based approaches that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its robust and superior performance across different scales of data. Experimental results underscore the superiority of our proposed method, indicating its potential for enhancing medical image classification tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | conference |

Methods: This paper proposes the Guided Conditional Diffusion Classifier (ConDiff), a novel deep-learning infection detection model that combines guided image synthesis with a denoising diffusion model and distance-based classification. The process involves (1) generating guided conditional synthetic images by injecting Gaussian noise to a guide image, followed by denoising the noise-perturbed image through a reverse diffusion process, conditioned on infection status and (2) classifying infections based on the minimum Euclidean distance between synthesized images and the original guide image in embedding space. Results: ConDiff demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 83% and an F1-score of 0.858, outperforming state-of-the-art models by at least 3%. The use of a triplet loss function reduces overfitting in the distance-based classifier. Conclusions: ConDiff not only enhances diagnostic accuracy for DFU infections but also pioneers the use of generative discriminative models for detailed medical image analysis, offering a promising approach for improving patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models facilitate high-fidelity medical image generation, reducing the costs associated with acquiring and annotating new images.

Specifically, we investigate three potential avenues: unconditional generation, generation guided by text, and a hybrid approach incorporating both textual and semantic supervision. We show that the rich contextual information present in the synthesized data potentially enhances the accuracy and interpretability of downstream tasks, such as echocardiography segmentation and classification with improved metrics and faster convergence.

To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index, and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks using a large-cohort study, specifically, the UK Biobank. We assess our method by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of younger patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments.

| **[Iterative Online Image Synthesis via Diffusion Model for Imbalanced Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08407v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust classification of diseases is important for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, medical datasets often face challenges related to limited sample sizes and inherent imbalanced distributions, due to difficulties in data collection and variations in disease prevalence across different types. In this paper, we introduce an Iterative Online Image Synthesis (IOIS) framework to address the class imbalance problem in medical image classification. Our framework incorporates two key modules, namely Online Image Synthesis (OIS) and Accuracy Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which collectively target the imbalance classification issue at both the instance level and the class level. The OIS module alleviates the data insufficiency problem by generating representative samples tailored for online training of the classifier. On the other hand, the AAS module dynamically balances the synthesized samples among various classes, targeting those with low training accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method in addressing imbalanced classification, we conduct experiments on the HAM10000 and APTOS datasets. The results obtained demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods as well as the effectiveness of each component. The source code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (weather, location, etc.). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata, and its heterogeneity poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce Time Weaver, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that Time Weaver outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 27% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion of Diffusion Weighted MRI and Clinical Data for Predicting Functional Outcome after Acute Ischemic Stroke with Deep Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10894v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stroke is a common disabling neurological condition that affects about one-quarter of the adult population over age 25; more than half of patients still have poor outcomes, such as permanent functional dependence or even death, after the onset of acute stroke. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted MRI modalities combining with structured health profile on predicting the functional outcome to facilitate early intervention. A deep fusion learning network is proposed with two-stage training: the first stage focuses on cross-modality representation learning and the second stage on classification. Supervised contrastive learning is exploited to learn discriminative features that separate the two classes of patients from embeddings of individual modalities and from the fused multimodal embedding. The network takes as the input DWI and ADC images, and structured health profile data. The outcome is the prediction of the patient needing long-term care at 3 months after the onset of stroke. Trained and evaluated with a dataset of 3297 patients, our proposed fusion model achieves 0.87, 0.80 and 80.45% for AUC, F1-score and accuracy, respectively, outperforming existing models that consolidate both imaging and structured data in the medical domain. If trained with comprehensive clinical variables, including NIHSS and comorbidities, the gain from images on making accurate prediction is not considered substantial, but significant. However, diffusion-weighted MRI can replace NIHSS to achieve comparable level of accuracy combining with other readily available clinical variables for better generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a noncontact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used. The final classification maps obtained have been analyzed and validated by specialists. These preliminary results are promising, obtaining an accurate delineation of the tumor area.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing computer-aided skin cancer classification systems employ deep learning approaches. However, recent studies reveal their extreme vulnerability to adversarial attacks -- often imperceptible perturbations to significantly reduce the performances of skin cancer diagnosis models. To mitigate these threats, this work presents a simple, effective, and resource-efficient defense framework by reverse engineering adversarial perturbations in skin cancer images. Specifically, a multiscale image pyramid is first established to better preserve discriminative structures in the medical imaging domain. To neutralize adversarial effects, skin images at different scales are then progressively diffused by injecting isotropic Gaussian noises to move the adversarial examples to the clean image manifold. Crucially, to further reverse adversarial noises and suppress redundant injected noises, a novel multiscale denoising mechanism is carefully designed that aggregates image information from neighboring scales. We evaluated the defensive effectiveness of our method on ISIC 2019, a largest skin cancer multiclass classification dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully reverse adversarial perturbations from different attacks and significantly outperform some state-of-the-art methods in defending skin cancer diagnosis models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

However, traditional data gathering methods are too slow for these scenarios necessitating innovative approaches to generate reliable models quickly from minimal data. We demonstrate our new approach by building a comprehensive computer vision model for detecting Human Papilloma Virus Genital warts using only synthetic data. In our study, we employed a two phase experimental design using diffusion models. In the first phase diffusion models were utilized to generate a large number of diverse synthetic images from 10 HPV guide images explicitly focusing on accurately depicting genital warts. The second phase involved the training and testing vision model using this synthetic dataset. This method aimed to assess the effectiveness of diffusion models in rapidly generating high quality training data and the subsequent impact on the vision model performance in medical image recognition. The study findings revealed significant insights into the performance of the vision model trained on synthetic images generated through diffusion models. The vision model showed exceptional performance in accurately identifying cases of genital warts. It achieved an accuracy rate of 96% underscoring its effectiveness in medical image classification. For HPV cases the model demonstrated a high precision of 99% and a recall of 94%. In normal cases the precision was 95% with an impressive recall of 99%. These metrics indicate the model capability to correctly identify true positive cases and minimize false positives. The model achieved an F1 Score of 96% for HPV cases and 97% for normal cases. The high F1 Score across both categories highlights the balanced nature of the model precision and recall ensuring reliability and robustness in its predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages 5 figures 1 table</p></details> |

Open-source medical datasets, while valuable, suffer from data quality and clinical information disparities. Generative models, such as diffusion models, aim to mitigate these challenges. At Stanford, researchers explored the utility of a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model (RoentGen) for medical imaging data augmentation. Our work examines specific considerations to expand the Stanford research question, Could Stable Diffusion Solve a Gap in Medical Imaging Data? from the lens of bias and validity of the generated outcomes. We leveraged RoentGen to produce synthetic Chest-XRay (CXR) images and conducted assessments on bias, validity, and hallucinations. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by a disease classifier, while a COVID classifier uncovered latent hallucinations. The bias analysis unveiled disparities in classification performance among various subgroups, with a pronounced impact on the Female Hispanic subgroup. Furthermore, incorporating race and gender into input prompts exacerbated fairness issues in the generated images. The quality of synthetic images exhibited variability, particularly in certain disease classes, where there was more significant uncertainty compared to the original images. Additionally, we observed latent hallucinations, with approximately 42% of the images incorrectly indicating COVID, hinting at the presence of hallucinatory elements. These identifications provide new research directions towards interpretability of synthetic CXR images, for further understanding of associated risks and patient safety in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) - "Medical Imaging Meets NeurIPS" Workshop</p></details> |

Our research demonstrates that by combining synthetic images, generated using diffusion models, with real images, we can enhance nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) classification performance even in low-data regime settings. We evaluate the quality of the synthetic images by comparing two metrics: Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID), computed on diffusion- and generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated images. Our results show superior performance for the diffusion-generated images, with a maximum IS score of $1.90$ compared to $1.67$ for GANs, and a minimum FID score of $69.45$ compared to $100.05$ for GANs. Utilizing a partially frozen CNN backbone (EfficientNet v1), our synthetic augmentation method achieves a maximum image-level ROC AUC of $0.904$ on a NAFLD prediction task.</p></details> | 36 pages, 13 figures |

However, their use for sequential data like respiratory sounds is less explored. In this work, we propose a straightforward approach to augment imbalanced respiratory sound data using an audio diffusion model as a conditional neural vocoder. We also demonstrate a simple yet effective adversarial fine-tuning method to align features between the synthetic and real respiratory sound samples to improve respiratory sound classification performance. Our experimental results on the ICBHI dataset demonstrate that the proposed adversarial fine-tuning is effective, while only using the conventional augmentation method shows performance degradation. Moreover, our method outperforms the baseline by 2.24% on the ICBHI Score and improves the accuracy of the minority classes up to 26.58%. For the supplementary material, we provide the code at https://github.com/kaen2891/adversarial_fine-tuning_using_generated_respiratory_sound.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Deep Generative Models for Health (DGM4H)</p></details> |
| **[Synthesizing Diabetic Foot Ulcer Images with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20140v1)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) is a serious skin wound requiring specialized care. However, real DFU datasets are limited, hindering clinical training and research activities. In recent years, generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating synthetic images with remarkable realism and diversity in many applications. This paper explores the potential of diffusion models for synthesizing DFU images and evaluates their authenticity through expert clinician assessments. Additionally, evaluation metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) are examined to assess the quality of the synthetic DFU images. A dataset of 2,000 DFU images is used for training the diffusion model, and the synthetic images are generated by applying diffusion processes. The results indicate that the diffusion model successfully synthesizes visually indistinguishable DFU images. 70% of the time, clinicians marked synthetic DFU images as real DFUs. However, clinicians demonstrate higher unanimous confidence in rating real images than synthetic ones. The study also reveals that FID and KID metrics do not significantly align with clinicians' assessments, suggesting alternative evaluation approaches are needed. The findings highlight the potential of diffusion models for generating synthetic DFU images and their impact on medical training programs and research in wound detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 6th Workshop on AI for Aging, Rehabilitation and Intelligent Assisted Living at European Conference on Machine Learning, Italy, 2023</p></details> |
| **[DiffSpectralNet : Unveiling the Potential of Diffusion Models for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12441v1)** | 2023-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images (HSI) have become popular for analysing remotely sensed images in multiple domain like agriculture, medical. However, existing models struggle with complex relationships and characteristics of spectral-spatial data due to the multi-band nature and data redundancy of hyperspectral data. To address this limitation, we propose a new network called DiffSpectralNet, which combines diffusion and transformer techniques. Our approach involves a two-step process. First, we use an unsupervised learning framework based on the diffusion model to extract both high-level and low-level spectral-spatial features. The diffusion method is capable of extracting diverse and meaningful spectral-spatial features, leading to improvement in HSI classification. Then, we employ a pretrained denoising U-Net to extract intermediate hierarchical features for classification. Finally, we use a supervised transformer-based classifier to perform the HSI classification. Through comprehensive experiments on HSI datasets, we evaluate the classification performance of DiffSpectralNet. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We may therefore increase the interpretability of deep learning models by imbuing them with a similar style of reasoning. In this work, we apply this principle by classifying Alzheimer's Disease based on the similarity of images to training examples within the latent space. We use a contrastive loss combined with a diffusion autoencoder backbone, to produce a semantically meaningful latent space, such that neighbouring latents have similar image-level features. We achieve a classification accuracy comparable to black box approaches on a dataset of 2D MRI images, whilst producing human interpretable model explanations. Therefore, this work stands as a contribution to the pertinent development of accurate and interpretable deep learning within medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certification of Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03664v1)** | 2023-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, segmentation models have known a significant improvement in the past decade and are now used daily in clinical practice. However, similar to classification models, segmentation models are affected by adversarial attacks. In a safety-critical field like healthcare, certifying model predictions is of the utmost importance. Randomized smoothing has been introduced lately and provides a framework to certify models and obtain theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we present for the first time a certified segmentation baseline for medical imaging based on randomized smoothing and diffusion models. Our results show that leveraging the power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models helps us overcome the limits of randomized smoothing. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets of chest X-rays, skin lesions, and colonoscopies, and empirically show that we are able to maintain high certified Dice scores even for highly perturbed images. Our work represents the first attempt to certify medical image segmentation models, and we aspire for it to set a foundation for future benchmarks in this crucial and largely uncharted area.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIE: Simulating Disease Progression via Progressive Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11745v2)** | 2023-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disease progression simulation is a crucial area of research that has significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from 35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2% of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to model disease trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and checkpoints for replicating our results can be found at https://github.com/IrohXu/PIE and https://huggingface.co/IrohXu/stable-diffusion-mimic-cxr-v0.1</p></details> |
| **[Reconstruction of Patient-Specific Confounders in AI-based Radiologic Image Interpretation using Generative Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17123v1)** | 2023-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting misleading patterns in automated diagnostic assistance systems, such as those powered by Artificial Intelligence, is critical to ensuring their reliability, particularly in healthcare. Current techniques for evaluating deep learning models cannot visualize confounding factors at a diagnostic level. Here, we propose a self-conditioned diffusion model termed DiffChest and train it on a dataset of 515,704 chest radiographs from 194,956 patients from multiple healthcare centers in the United States and Europe. DiffChest explains classifications on a patient-specific level and visualizes the confounding factors that may mislead the model. We found high inter-reader agreement when evaluating DiffChest's capability to identify treatment-related confounders, with Fleiss' Kappa values of 0.8 or higher across most imaging findings. Confounders were accurately captured with 11.1% to 100% prevalence rates. Furthermore, our pretraining process optimized the model to capture the most relevant information from the input radiographs. DiffChest achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy when diagnosing 11 chest conditions, such as pleural effusion and cardiac insufficiency, and at least sufficient diagnostic accuracy for the remaining conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of pretraining based on diffusion models in medical image classification, specifically in providing insights into confounding factors and model robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Structural and Functional Connectivities using Disentangled VAE for Detecting MCI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09629v2)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain network analysis is a useful approach to studying human brain disorders because it can distinguish patients from healthy people by detecting abnormal connections. Due to the complementary information from multiple modal neuroimages, multimodal fusion technology has a lot of potential for improving prediction performance. However, effective fusion of multimodal medical images to achieve complementarity is still a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel hierarchical structural-functional connectivity fusing (HSCF) model is proposed to construct brain structural-functional connectivity matrices and predict abnormal brain connections based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Specifically, the prior knowledge is incorporated into the separators for disentangling each modality of information by the graph convolutional networks (GCN). And a disentangled cosine distance loss is devised to ensure the disentanglement's effectiveness. Moreover, the hierarchical representation fusion module is designed to effectively maximize the combination of relevant and effective features between modalities, which makes the generated structural-functional connectivity more robust and discriminative in the cognitive disease analysis. Results from a wide range of tests performed on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database show that the proposed model performs better than competing approaches in terms of classification evaluation. In general, the proposed HSCF model is a promising model for generating brain structural-functional connectivities and identifying abnormal brain connections as cognitive disease progresses.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Synthetic Augmentation with Large-scale Unconditional Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04020v1)** | 2023-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based medical image recognition systems often require a substantial amount of training data with expert annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Recently, synthetic augmentation techniques have been proposed to mitigate the issue by generating realistic images conditioned on class labels. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the representation capability of the trained generative model, which cannot be guaranteed without sufficient labeled training data. To further reduce the dependency on annotated data, we propose a synthetic augmentation method called HistoDiffusion, which can be pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and later applied to a small-scale labeled dataset for augmented training. In particular, we train a latent diffusion model (LDM) on diverse unlabeled datasets to learn common features and generate realistic images without conditional inputs. Then, we fine-tune the model with classifier guidance in latent space on an unseen labeled dataset so that the model can synthesize images of specific categories. Additionally, we adopt a selective mechanism to only add synthetic samples with high confidence of matching to target labels. We evaluate our proposed method by pre-training on three histopathology datasets and testing on a histopathology dataset of colorectal cancer (CRC) excluded from the pre-training datasets. With HistoDiffusion augmentation, the classification accuracy of a backbone classifier is remarkably improved by 6.4% using a small set of the original labels. Our code is available at https://github.com/karenyyy/HistoDiffAug.</p></details> | MICCAI 2023 |
| **[Deep Learning Approaches for Data Augmentation in Medical Imaging: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13125v1)** | 2023-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has become a popular tool for medical image analysis, but the limited availability of training data remains a major challenge, particularly in the medical field where data acquisition can be costly and subject to privacy regulations. Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[FEDD -- Fair, Efficient, and Diverse Diffusion-based Lesion Segmentation and Malignancy Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11654v1)** | 2023-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skin diseases affect millions of people worldwide, across all ethnicities. Increasing diagnosis accessibility requires fair and accurate segmentation and classification of dermatology images. However, the scarcity of annotated medical images, especially for rare diseases and underrepresented skin tones, poses a challenge to the development of fair and accurate models. In this study, we introduce a Fair, Efficient, and Diverse Diffusion-based framework for skin lesion segmentation and malignancy classification. FEDD leverages semantically meaningful feature embeddings learned through a denoising diffusion probabilistic backbone and processes them via linear probes to achieve state-of-the-art performance on Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). We achieve an improvement in intersection over union of 0.18, 0.13, 0.06, and 0.07 while using only 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% labeled samples, respectively. Additionally, FEDD trained on 10% of DDI demonstrates malignancy classification accuracy of 81%, 14% higher compared to the state-of-the-art. We showcase high efficiency in data-constrained scenarios while providing fair performance for diverse skin tones and rare malignancy conditions. Our newly annotated DDI segmentation masks and training code can be found on https://github.com/hectorcarrion/fedd.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMIC: Dual-Guidance Diffusion Network for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10610v3)** | 2023-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models have recently shown remarkable performance in generative image modeling, attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. However, while a substantial amount of diffusion-based research has focused on generative tasks, few studies have applied diffusion models to general medical image classification. In this paper, we propose the first diffusion-based model (named DiffMIC) to address general medical image classification by eliminating unexpected noise and perturbations in medical images and robustly capturing semantic representation. To achieve this goal, we devise a dual conditional guidance strategy that conditions each diffusion step with multiple granularities to improve step-wise regional attention. Furthermore, we propose learning the mutual information in each granularity by enforcing Maximum-Mean Discrepancy regularization during the diffusion forward process. We evaluate the effectiveness of our DiffMIC on three medical classification tasks with different image modalities, including placental maturity grading on ultrasound images, skin lesion classification using dermatoscopic images, and diabetic retinopathy grading using fundus images. Our experimental results demonstrate that DiffMIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, indicating the universality and effectiveness of the proposed model. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/scott-yjyang/DiffMIC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Nuclei Representations with Masked Image Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17116v1)** | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked image modelling (MIM) is a powerful self-supervised representation learning paradigm, whose potential has not been widely demonstrated in medical image analysis. In this work, we show the capacity of MIM to capture rich semantic representations of Haemotoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained images at the nuclear level. Inspired by Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers (BEiT), we split the images into smaller patches and generate corresponding discrete visual tokens. In addition to the regular grid-based patches, typically used in visual Transformers, we introduce patches of individual cell nuclei. We propose positional encoding of the irregular distribution of these structures within an image. We pre-train the model in a self-supervised manner on H&E-stained whole-slide images of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where cell nuclei have been segmented. The pre-training objective is to recover the original discrete visual tokens of the masked image on the one hand, and to reconstruct the visual tokens of the masked object instances on the other. Coupling these two pre-training tasks allows us to build powerful, context-aware representations of nuclei. Our model generalizes well and can be fine-tuned on downstream classification tasks, achieving improved cell classification accuracy on PanNuke dataset by more than 5% compared to current instance segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

Due to ethical concerns, obtaining sufficient medical data for machine learning is a challenge, which our approach aims to address by synthesising more data. We utilised the Chest X-ray 14 dataset for our experiments and evaluated the performance of our models through qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our results show that the generated images are visually convincing and can be used to improve the accuracy of classification models. However, further work is needed to address issues such as overfitting and the limited availability of real data for training and testing. The potential of our approach to contribute to more effective medical diagnosis through deep learning is promising, and we believe that continued advancements in image generation technology will lead to even more promising results in the future.</p></details> |  |

It can be classified into several subtypes, including clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed and trained for classifying different subtypes of RCC using ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a dataset of RCC histopathology images, which consisted of digital images of RCC surgical resection slides that were annotated with the corresponding subtype labels. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, in this research, a novel synthetic image generation tool, NephroNet, is developed on diffusion models that are used to generate original images of RCC surgical resection slides. Diffusion models are a class of generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from noise. Several diffusers such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth Text-to-Image, and Textual Inversion were trained on a dataset of RCC images and were used to generate a series of original images that resembled RCC surgical resection slides, all within the span of fewer than four seconds. The generated images were visually realistic and could be used for creating new training datasets, testing the performance of image analysis algorithms, and training medical professionals. NephroNet is provided as an open-source software package and contains files for data preprocessing, training, and visualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence and diffusion models for classifying and generating RCC images, respectively. These methods could be useful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of RCC and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, labeled training data for real-world applications such as healthcare is limited and difficult to access given longstanding privacy, and strict data sharing policies. By manipulating image datasets in the pixel or feature space, existing data augmentation techniques represent one of the effective ways to improve the quantity and diversity of training data. Here, we look to advance augmentation techniques by building upon the emerging success of text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models in augmenting the training samples of our macroscopic skin disease dataset. We do so by enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process via input text prompts. We demonstrate that this generative data augmentation approach successfully maintains a similar classification accuracy of the visual classifier even when trained on a fully synthetic skin disease dataset. Similar to recent applications of generative models, our study suggests that diffusion models are indeed effective in generating high-quality skin images that do not sacrifice the classifier performance, and can improve the augmentation of training datasets after curation.</p></details> |  |

However, biometric identifiers in chest radiographs hinder the public sharing of such data for research purposes due to the risk of patient re-identification. To counteract this issue, synthetic data generation offers a solution for anonymizing medical images. This work employs a latent diffusion model to synthesize an anonymous chest X-ray dataset of high-quality class-conditional images. We propose a privacy-enhancing sampling strategy to ensure the non-transference of biometric information during the image generation process. The quality of the generated images and the feasibility of serving as exclusive training data are evaluated on a thoracic abnormality classification task. Compared to a real classifier, we achieve competitive results with a performance gap of only 3.5% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Automatic Identification of Claim Spans on Twitter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04710v2)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread diffusion of medical and political claims in the wake of COVID-19 has led to a voluminous rise in misinformation and fake news. The current vogue is to employ manual fact-checkers to efficiently classify and verify such data to combat this avalanche of claim-ridden misinformation. However, the rate of information dissemination is such that it vastly outpaces the fact-checkers' strength. Therefore, to aid manual fact-checkers in eliminating the superfluous content, it becomes imperative to automatically identify and extract the snippets of claim-worthy (mis)information present in a post. In this work, we introduce the novel task of Claim Span Identification (CSI). We propose CURT, a large-scale Twitter corpus with token-level claim spans on more than 7.5k tweets. Furthermore, along with the standard token classification baselines, we benchmark our dataset with DABERTa, an adapter-based variation of RoBERTa. The experimental results attest that DABERTa outperforms the baseline systems across several evaluation metrics, improving by about 1.5 points. We also report detailed error analysis to validate the model's performance along with the ablation studies. Lastly, we release our comprehensive span annotation guidelines for public use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP22. 16 pages including Appendix</p></details> |

Neuropathic Pain (NP) is a common sub-type which is often caused due to nerve damage and has a known pathophysiology. Another common sub-type is Fibromyalgia (FM) which is described as musculoskeletal, diffuse pain that is widespread through the body. The pathophysiology of FM is poorly understood, making it very hard to diagnose. Standard medications and treatments for FM and NP differ from one another and if misdiagnosed it can cause an increase in symptom severity. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel framework, PainPoints, which accurately detects the sub-type of pain and generates clinical notes via summarizing the patient interviews. Specifically, PainPoints makes use of large language models to perform sentence-level classification of the text obtained from interviews of FM and NP patients with a reliable AUC of 0.83. Using a sufficiency-based interpretability approach, we explain how the fine-tuned model accurately picks up on the nuances that patients use to describe their pain. Finally, we generate summaries of these interviews via expert interventions by introducing a novel facet-based approach. PainPoints thus enables practitioners to add/drop facets and generate a custom summary based on the notion of "facet-coverage" which is also introduced in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prostate Lesion Detection and Salient Feature Assessment Using Zone-Based Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11522v1)** | 2022-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has a growing role in detecting prostate cancer lesions. Thus, it is pertinent that medical professionals who interpret these scans reduce the risk of human error by using computer-aided detection systems. The variety of algorithms used in system implementation, however, has yielded mixed results. Here we investigate the best machine learning classifier for each prostate zone. We also discover salient features to clarify the models' classification rationale. Of the data provided, we gathered and augmented T2 weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient map images to extract first through third order statistical features as input to machine learning classifiers. For our deep learning classifier, we used a convolutional neural net (CNN) architecture for automatic feature extraction and classification. The interpretability of the CNN results was improved by saliency mapping to understand the classification mechanisms within. Ultimately, we concluded that effective detection of peripheral and anterior fibromuscular stroma (AS) lesions depended more on statistical distribution features, whereas those in the transition zone (TZ) depended more on textural features. Ensemble algorithms worked best for PZ and TZ zones, while CNNs were best in the AS zone. These classifiers can be used to validate a radiologist's predictions and reduce inter-reader variability in patients suspected to have prostate cancer. The salient features reported in this study can also be investigated further to better understand hidden features and biomarkers of prostate lesions with mpMRIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Fully Distributed Federated Learning with Adaptive Local Links](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12281v1)** | 2022-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, data-driven, machine and deep learning approaches have provided unprecedented performance in various complex tasks, including image classification and object detection, and in a variety of application areas, like autonomous vehicles, medical imaging and wireless communications. Traditionally, such approaches have been deployed, along with the involved datasets, on standalone devices. Recently, a shift has been observed towards the so-called Edge Machine Learning, in which centralized architectures are adopted that allow multiple devices with local computational and storage resources to collaborate with the assistance of a centralized server. The well-known federated learning approach is able to utilize such architectures by allowing the exchange of only parameters with the server, while keeping the datasets private to each contributing device. In this work, we propose a fully distributed, diffusion-based learning algorithm that does not require a central server and propose an adaptive combination rule for the cooperation of the devices. By adopting a classification task on the MNIST dataset, the efficacy of the proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts is demonstrated via the reduction of the number of collaboration rounds required to achieve an acceptable accuracy level in non- IID dataset scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Indicative Image Retrieval: Turning Blackbox Learning into Grey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11898v2)** | 2022-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning became the game changer for image retrieval soon after it was introduced. It promotes the feature extraction (by representation learning) as the core of image retrieval, with the relevance/matching evaluation being degenerated into simple similarity metrics. In many applications, we need the matching evidence to be indicated rather than just have the ranked list (e.g., the locations of the target proteins/cells/lesions in medical images). It is like the matched words need to be highlighted in search engines. However, this is not easy to implement without explicit relevance/matching modeling. The deep representation learning models are not feasible because of their blackbox nature. In this paper, we revisit the importance of relevance/matching modeling in deep learning era with an indicative retrieval setting. The study shows that it is possible to skip the representation learning and model the matching evidence directly. By removing the dependency on the pre-trained models, it has avoided a lot of related issues (e.g., the domain gap between classification and retrieval, the detail-diffusion caused by convolution, and so on). More importantly, the study demonstrates that the matching can be explicitly modeled and backtracked later for generating the matching evidence indications. It can improve the explainability of deep inference. Our method obtains a best performance in literature on both Oxford-5k and Paris-6k, and sets a new record of 97.77% on Oxford-5k (97.81% on Paris-6k) without extracting any deep features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-transfer learning via patches: A prostate cancer triage approach based on bi-parametric MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10806v1)** | 2021-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer diagnosed among men worldwide. The current PCa diagnostic pathway comes at the cost of substantial overdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatment and further testing. Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) based on apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) sequences has been proposed as a triage test to differentiate between clinically significant (cS) and non-clinically significant (ncS) prostate lesions. However, analysis of the sequences relies on expertise, requires specialized training, and suffers from inter-observer variability. Deep learning (DL) techniques hold promise in tasks such as classification and detection. Nevertheless, they rely on large amounts of annotated data which is not common in the medical field. In order to palliate such issues, existing works rely on transfer learning (TL) and ImageNet pre-training, which has been proven to be sub-optimal for the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we present a patch-based pre-training strategy to distinguish between cS and ncS lesions which exploit the region of interest (ROI) of the patched source domain to efficiently train a classifier in the full-slice target domain which does not require annotations by making use of transfer learning (TL). We provide a comprehensive comparison between several CNNs architectures and different settings which are presented as a baseline. Moreover, we explore cross-domain TL which exploits both MRI modalities and improves single modality results. Finally, we show how our approaches outperform the standard approaches by a considerable margin</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages. Article under review</p></details> |

The advances in machine learning and publicly available medical datasets initiated multiple studies in AD diagnosis. In this work, we utilize a multi-modal deep learning approach in classifying normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment and AD classes on the basis of structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans from the OASIS-3 dataset. In addition to a conventional multi-modal network, we also present an input agnostic architecture that allows diagnosis with either sMRI or DTI scan, which distinguishes our method from previous multi-modal machine learning-based methods. The results show that the input agnostic model achieves 0.96 accuracy when both structural MRI and DTI scans are provided as inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, submitted to EMBC 2021</p></details> |

Accurately detecting and segmenting lymphomas from these two imaging modalities are critical tasks for cancer staging and radiotherapy planning. However, this task is still challenging due to the complexity of PET/CT images, and the computation cost to process 3D data. In this paper, a segmentation method based on belief functions is proposed to segment lymphomas in 3D PET/CT images. The architecture is composed of a feature extraction module and an evidential segmentation (ES) module. The ES module outputs not only segmentation results (binary maps indicating the presence or absence of lymphoma in each voxel) but also uncertainty maps quantifying the classification uncertainty. The whole model is optimized by minimizing Dice and uncertainty loss functions to increase segmentation accuracy. The method was evaluated on a database of 173 patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Belief2021 |

Action-driven video generation faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions (HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeAdQA: LLM-Driven Context-Aware Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14784v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[InterRVOS: Interaction-aware Referring Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02356v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in a video described by a natural language expression. However, most existing approaches focus on segmenting only the referred object (typically the actor), even when the expression clearly describes an interaction involving multiple objects with distinct roles. For instance, "A throwing B" implies a directional interaction, but standard RVOS segments only the actor (A), neglecting other involved target objects (B). In this paper, we introduce Interaction-aware Referring Video Object Segmentation (InterRVOS), a novel task that focuses on the modeling of interactions. It requires the model to segment the actor and target objects separately, reflecting their asymmetric roles in an interaction. This task formulation enables fine-grained understanding of object relationships, as many video events are defined by such relationships rather than individual objects. To support this task, we propose a new evaluation protocol that separately evaluates actor and target segmentation, enabling more accurate assessment of the model's ability to distinguish and segment actor and target roles. We also present InterRVOS-127K, a large-scale dataset with over 127K automatically annotated expressions, including interaction expressions annotated with distinct masks for actor and target objects. Furthermore, we develop ReVIOSa, an MLLM-based architecture that introduces interaction-aware special tokens and leverages an attention mask loss to enhance role-specific segmentation. Extensive experiments show that ReVIOSa not only outperforms existing baselines on our proposed InterRVOS-127K evaluation set, but also achieves strong performance on standard RVOS benchmarks.

While MLLMs excel at visual perception and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.

An eye-catching creative image can enhance the shopping experience for users, boosting income for advertisers and advertising revenue for platforms. With the advent of AIGC technology, advertisers can produce large quantities of creative images at minimal cost. However, they struggle to assess the creative quality to select. Existing methods primarily focus on creative ranking, which fails to address the need for explainable creative selection. In this work, we propose the first paradigm for explainable creative assessment and selection. Powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs), our approach integrates the assessment and selection of creative images into a natural language generation task. To facilitate this research, we construct CreativePair, the first comparative reasoning-induced creative dataset featuring 8k annotated image pairs, with each sample including a label indicating which image is superior. Additionally, we introduce Creative4U (pronounced Creative for You), a MLLMs-based creative selector that takes into account users' interests. Through Reason-to-Select RFT, which includes supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning, Creative4U is able to evaluate and select creative images accurately. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and dataset will be made public to advance research and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current explainable IQA methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding, detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework. This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heuristic-Induced Multimodal Risk Distribution Jailbreak Attack for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05934v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), concerns regarding their security have increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, designing effective jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given the highly constrained adversarial capabilities in real-world deployment scenarios. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting in limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which is black-box and consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy and heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution strategy is used to distribute harmful semantics into multiple modalities to effectively circumvent the single-modality protection mechanisms of MLLMs. The heuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the understanding-enhancing prompt, which helps MLLMs reconstruct the malicious prompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative outputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. HIMRD achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 90% across seven open-source MLLMs and an average ASR of around 68% in three closed-source MLLMs. HIMRD reveals cross-modal security vulnerabilities in current MLLMs and underscores the imperative for developing defensive strategies to mitigate such emerging risks.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) offer unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive ASA by simultaneously processing audio and text within unified frameworks. This paper presents a very first systematic study of MLLM for comprehensive ASA, demonstrating the superior performance of MLLM across the aspects of content and language use . However, assessment on the delivery aspect reveals unique challenges, which is deemed to require specialized training strategies. We thus propose Speech-First Multimodal Training (SFMT), leveraging a curriculum learning principle to establish more robust modeling foundations of speech before cross-modal synergetic fusion. A series of experiments on a benchmark dataset show MLLM-based systems can elevate the holistic assessment performance from a PCC value of 0.783 to 0.846. In particular, SFMT excels in the evaluation of the delivery aspect, achieving an absolute accuracy improvement of 4% over conventional training approaches, which also paves a new avenue for ASA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ASRU 2025</p></details> |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

This limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models' understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement, where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and "Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators (Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and accurate image generation.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional score-based evaluation metrics can quantify certain forecast errors, they are still far from meteorological experts in terms of descriptive capability, interpretability, and understanding of dynamic evolution. With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), these models become potential tools to overcome the above challenges. In this work, we introduce an MLLM-based weather forecast analysis method, RadarQA, integrating key physical attributes with detailed assessment reports. We introduce a novel and comprehensive task paradigm for multi-modal quality analysis, encompassing both single frame and sequence, under both rating and assessment scenarios. To support training and benchmarking, we design a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines human expert labeling with automated heuristics. With such an annotation method, we construct RQA-70K, a large-scale dataset with varying difficulty levels for radar forecast quality evaluation. We further design a multi-stage training strategy that iteratively improves model performance at each stage. Extensive experiments show that RadarQA outperforms existing general MLLMs across all evaluation settings, highlighting its potential for advancing quality analysis in weather prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region-Level Context-Aware Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12263v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

Inspired by OpenAI's o3 model, which emulates human-like ''thinking with image'' through iterative visual transformations and linguistic reasoning, we propose Simple o3, an end-to-end framework that integrates dynamic tool interactions (e.g., cropping, zooming, and reusing) into interleaved vision-language reasoning via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our approach features a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality interleaved vision-language reasoning chains via an ''observe-reason-act'' cycle, complete with executable visual operations and rigorous verification, yielding the open-source TWI-Tools-146K dataset. Experimental results demonstrate Simple o3's superior performance on diverse benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches. By combining enhanced reasoning capabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable paradigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first in-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering insights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing additional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and magnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual reasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise visual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or regions, further enhancing its capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventHallusion: Diagnosing Event Hallucinations in Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16597v5)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in the video comprehension field. Despite remarkable content reasoning and instruction following capabilities they demonstrated, the hallucination problem of these VideoLLMs is less explored compared with its counterpart in the image domain. To mitigate this gap, we propose EventHallusion, a novel benchmark that focuses on assessing the VideoLLMs' hallucination toward event, the crux of video analysis. From a hallucination attribution perspective, our EventHallusion benchmark is curated to assess a VideoLLM's susceptibility toward language priors and vision-language biases. On the other hand, we also propose a simple yet effective method, called Temporal Contrastive Decoding (TCD), to tackle the hallucination problems of VideoLLMs. The proposed TCD method rectifies the model's bias toward its priors during the decoding stage by comparing the original video with a modified version, in which temporal cues are disrupted. Through comprehensive evaluation of eight open-source and two closed-source VideoLLMs on the proposed EventHallusion benchmark, we observe that the open-source models suffer significantly from hallucination problems, whereas the closed-source ones perform markedly better. By further equipping open-source VideoLLMs with the proposed TCD approach, evident performance improvements are achieved across most metrics in the EventHallusion benchmark. Our codes and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/Stevetich/EventHallusion.</p></details> |  |

For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20% of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning baselines under varying pruning ratios.</p></details> |  |

However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and computational operations via executable code. This approach not only facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations, all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation, followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20 benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains, particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thyme-vl.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ovis2.5 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11737v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native, variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional "thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its scale for complex chart analysis.</p></details> |  |

While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments.

Existing methods for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1) grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> |  |

While several benchmarks evaluate Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) under Multimodal RAG settings, they predominantly retrieve from textual corpora and do not explicitly assess how models exploit visual evidence during generation. Consequently, there still lacks benchmark that isolates and measures the contribution of retrieved images in RAG. We introduce Visual-RAG, a question-answering benchmark that targets visually grounded, knowledge-intensive questions. Unlike prior work, Visual-RAG requires text-to-image retrieval and the integration of retrieved clue images to extract visual evidence for answer generation. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-source and 3 proprietary MLLMs, showcasing that images provide strong evidence in augmented generation. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle to efficiently extract and utilize visual knowledge. Our results highlight the need for improved visual retrieval, grounding, and attribution in multimodal RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 17 tables</p></details> |

Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs, further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10016v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%, and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[ElasticMM: Efficient Multimodal LLMs Serving with Elastic Multimodal Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10069v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalizable Forgery Detection and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21210v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and interpretable detection of AI-generated images is essential for mitigating risks associated with AI misuse. However, the substantial domain gap among generative models makes it challenging to develop a generalizable forgery detection model. Moreover, since every pixel in an AI-generated image is synthesized, traditional saliency-based forgery explanation methods are not well suited for this task. To address these challenges, we formulate detection and explanation as a unified Forgery Detection and Reasoning task (FDR-Task), leveraging Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide accurate detection through reliable reasoning over forgery attributes. To facilitate this task, we introduce the Multi-Modal Forgery Reasoning dataset (MMFR-Dataset), a large-scale dataset containing 120K images across 10 generative models, with 378K reasoning annotations on forgery attributes, enabling comprehensive evaluation of the FDR-Task. Furthermore, we propose FakeReasoning, a forgery detection and reasoning framework with three key components: 1) a dual-branch visual encoder that integrates CLIP and DINO to capture both high-level semantics and low-level artifacts; 2) a Forgery-Aware Feature Fusion Module that leverages DINO's attention maps and cross-attention mechanisms to guide MLLMs toward forgery-related clues; 3) a Classification Probability Mapper that couples language modeling and forgery detection, enhancing overall performance. Experiments across multiple generative models demonstrate that FakeReasoning not only achieves robust generalization but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both detection and reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TBAC-UniImage: Unified Understanding and Generation by Ladder-Side Diffusion Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08098v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm. Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple, diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model. This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently, TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoCross: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Cross-Domain Egocentric Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10729v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering (EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs, whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models. Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be released at: \href{https://github.com/MyUniverse0726/EgoCross}{https://github.com/MyUniverse0726/EgoCross.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Debiasing Multimodal Large Language Models via Penalization of Language Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05262v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in generating textual responses based on visual inputs. Despite their advancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias: the generated content is often driven more by the inherent priors of the underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) than by the input image. Empirical experiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as MLLMs often provide confident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent visual inputs. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward visual information, we propose two simple, training-free strategies. First, for tasks such as classification or multi-choice question answering, we introduce a "Post-Hoc Debias" method using an affine calibration step to adjust the output distribution. This approach ensures uniform answer scores when the image is absent, acting as an effective regularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more intricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to "Visual Debias Decoding", which mitigates bias by contrasting token log-probabilities conditioned on a correct image versus a meaningless one. Additionally, our investigation sheds light on the instability of MLLMs across various decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different settings, we achieve significant performance improvements--surpassing previously reported results--and raise concerns about the fairness of current evaluation practices. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in mitigating biases. These strategies not only prove beneficial in minimizing hallucinations but also contribute to the generation of more helpful and precise illustrations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
| **[DAS: Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs Empowered Industrial Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10584v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic IDs are discrete identifiers generated by quantizing the Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) embeddings, enabling efficient multi-modal content integration in recommendation systems. However, their lack of collaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative and generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced various alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage framework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable information loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive alignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information maximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method that simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic integrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically associated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient alignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the following two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative Alignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and collaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and then design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item (u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual quantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads achieve stronger alignment. Finally, we conduct extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests to evaluate DAS's effectiveness, which is now successfully deployed across various advertising scenarios at Kuaishou App, serving over 400 million users daily.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Here we introduce HumanSense, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks. Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

However, these models suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities, including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of 0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |

Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that LLaVA model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5\% to 93.2\% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0\% to 85.7\% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.

Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper, we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math 2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual expansion.

Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data, poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance. Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools: (1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities, offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

However, its application in multi-modal human activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR. Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image, each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

| **[CapeLLM: Support-Free Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06869v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) has traditionally relied on support images with annotated keypoints, a process that is often cumbersome and may fail to fully capture the necessary correspondences across diverse object categories. Recent efforts have explored the use of text queries, leveraging their enhanced stability and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches often remain constrained by their reliance on support queries, their failure to fully utilize the rich priors embedded in pre-trained large language models, and the limitations imposed by their parametric distribution assumptions. To address these challenges, we introduce CapeLLM, the first multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for CAPE. Our method only employs query image and detailed text descriptions as an input to estimate category-agnostic keypoints. Our method encompasses effective training strategies and carefully designed instructions for applying the MLLM to CAPE. Moreover, we propose an inference mechanism that further enhances the reasoning process for unseen keypoints. while flexibly modeling their underlying spatial distribution and uncertainty, allowing for adaptive refinement based on contextual cues. We conducted extensive experiments to apply the MLLM to CAPE effectively, focusing not only on the model architecture and prompt design but also on ensuring robustness across input variations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the MP-100 benchmark in the 1-shot and even 5-shot setting, marking a significant advancement in the field of category-agnostic pose estimation.

However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://xenozlh.github.io/Shuffle-R1/</p></details> |

However, the rapid expansion of visual instruction datasets introduces data redundancy, leading to excessive computational costs. We propose a collaborative framework, DataTailor, which leverages three key principles--informativeness, uniqueness, and representativeness--for effective data selection. We argue that a valuable sample should be informative of the task, non-redundant, and represent the sample distribution (i.e., not an outlier). We further propose practical ways to score against each principle, which automatically adapts to a given dataset without tedious hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DataTailor achieves 101.3% of the performance of full-data fine-tuning with only 15% of the data, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining superior results. This exemplifies the "Less is More" philosophy in MLLM development. The code and data is available in this \href{https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/DataTailor}{URL}.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight |

Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

However, their ability to interpret music sheets remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MusiXQA, the first comprehensive dataset for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in music sheet understanding. MusiXQA features high-quality synthetic music sheets generated via MusiXTeX, with structured annotations covering note pitch and duration, chords, clefs, key/time signatures, and text, enabling diverse visual QA tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we reveal significant limitations of current state-of-the-art MLLMs in this domain. Beyond benchmarking, we developed Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant performance gains over GPT-based methods. The proposed dataset and model establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet understanding.

As demonstrated across many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various complexity, which were not previously possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Modality Gaps in e-Commerce Products via Vision-Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10116v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Item information, such as titles and attributes, is essential for effective user engagement in e-commerce. However, manual or semi-manual entry of structured item specifics often produces inconsistent quality, errors, and slow turnaround, especially for Customer-to-Customer sellers. Generating accurate descriptions directly from item images offers a promising alternative. Existing retrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss fine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories. We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for generating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key challenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality gaps and capturing detailed contextual information. It introduces two data refinement methods: MLLM-Assisted Conformity Enhancement, which ensures alignment with structured schema requirements, and LLM-Assisted Contextual Understanding, which improves the capture of nuanced and fine-grained information from visual inputs. OPAL uses visual instruction tuning combined with direct preference optimization to fine-tune the MLLM, reducing hallucinations and improving robustness across different backbone architectures. We evaluate OPAL on real-world e-commerce datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline methods in both description quality and schema completion rates. These results demonstrate that OPAL effectively bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities, delivering richer, more accurate, and more consistent item descriptions. This work advances automated listing optimization and supports scalable, high-quality content generation in e-commerce platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaCE-10: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Compositional Spatial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07966v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to generate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging strategy and new datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency} and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these, we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1) \textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2) \textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion, refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis, video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding and interpreting the behavior of such complex models is a challenging task, not to mention the dynamic shifts that may occur during fine-tuning, or due to covariate shift between datasets. In this work, we apply concept-level analysis towards MLLM understanding. More specifically, we propose to map hidden states to interpretable visual and textual concepts. This enables us to more efficiently compare certain semantic dynamics, such as the shift from an original and fine-tuned model, revealing concept alteration and potential biases that may occur during fine-tuning. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by applying simple, computationally inexpensive additive concept shifts in the original model. Finally, our findings also have direct applications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well as enforcing safety in MLLM output. All in all, we propose a novel, training-free, ready-to-use framework for MLLM behavior interpretability and control.

These low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper semantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate with viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or an ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such distinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible to traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple, recommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects high-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip into a rich natural-language description (e.g. "a superhero parody with slapstick fights and orchestral stabs"), bridging the gap between raw content and user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and feed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative recommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions with TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional video, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to build more intent-aware video recommenders.</p></details> |  |

This "seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust, multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities, significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are withdrawing this preprint because it is undergoing a major revision and restructuring.

Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09105v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance, rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus undermining privacy leakage accountability To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities. To address the environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition, SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data provenance in complex generative systems.</p></details> |  |

However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Our framework, CoherenDream, achieves consistent improvement across multiple metrics on TIFA subset.As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce VisFinEval, the first large-scale Chinese benchmark that spans the full front-middle-back office lifecycle of financial tasks. VisFinEval comprises 15,848 annotated question-answer pairs drawn from eight common financial image modalities (e.g., K-line charts, financial statements, official seals), organized into three hierarchical scenario depths: Financial Knowledge & Data Analysis, Financial Analysis & Decision Support, and Financial Risk Control & Asset Optimization. We evaluate 21 state-of-the-art MLLMs in a zero-shot setting. The top model, Qwen-VL-max, achieves an overall accuracy of 76.3%, outperforming non-expert humans but trailing financial experts by over 14 percentage points. Our error analysis uncovers six recurring failure modes-including cross-modal misalignment, hallucinations, and lapses in business-process reasoning-that highlight critical avenues for future research. VisFinEval aims to accelerate the development of robust, domain-tailored MLLMs capable of seamlessly integrating textual and visual financial information.

However, the absence of rigorous and systematic benchmarks has hindered progress in this area. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MLLM-CTBench}, a dataset curating seven challenging tasks from six diverse domains with three contributions. First,to enable fine-grained analysis of continual learning ability, we introduce \textbf{multidimensional evaluation metrics}, which combines final answer accuracy with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning quality assessment through a carefully trained MLLM evaluator. Then, we conduct a \textbf{comprehensive evaluation of continual learning algorithms}, systematically assessing eight algorithms from four major categories to provide actionable insights for algorithm design and adoption. Finally ,we evaluate the efficacy of \textbf{Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) versus Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)} in maintaining model performance across sequential tasks during continual instruction tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that reasoning processes in MLLMs exhibit greater resilience than final outputs to forgetting during continual learning, aligning with cognitive theories of hierarchical forgetting. We further show that both model capability and task sequence significantly influence continual learning outcomes, with stronger baseline models exhibiting greater resistance to forgetting. Notably, properly regularized RFT emerges as a more robust approach than SFT for maintaining performance across tasks.One of the key contributing factors is KL-divergence regularization, without which RFT leads to even worse forgetting than SFT on old tasks though may perform better on new tasks.</p></details> | under review |
| **[A Simple yet Powerful Instance-Aware Prompting Framework for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06904v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings. While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2) \textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3) Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art training-free COS methods.</p></details> | under review |

However, this integration often significantly decreases performance on natural language understanding and generation tasks, compared to the original LLM. This study investigates this issue using the LLaVA MLLM, treating the integration as a continual learning problem. We evaluate five continual learning methods to mitigate forgetting and identify a technique that enhances visual understanding while minimizing linguistic performance loss. Our approach reduces linguistic performance degradation by up to 15% over the LLaVA recipe, while maintaining high multimodal accuracy. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method through continual learning on a sequence of vision-language tasks, effectively preserving linguistic skills while acquiring new multimodal capabilities.

However, challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function, enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46, highlighting considerable potential for enhancement.

Conventional outdoor monitoring relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative, utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework, named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

To address these issues, we propose Dopamine Audiobook, a novel unified training-free multi-agent system, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves two specialized roles (i.e., speech designer and audio designer) for emotional, human-like, and immersive audiobook generation and evaluation. Specifically, we firstly propose a flow-based, context-aware framework for diverse audio generation with word-level semantic and temporal alignment. To enhance expressiveness, we then design word-level paralinguistic augmentation, utterance-level prosody retrieval, and adaptive TTS model selection. Finally, for evaluation, we introduce a novel MLLM-based evaluation framework incorporating self-critique, perspective-taking, and psychological MagicEmo prompts to ensure human-aligned and self-aligned assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple metrics. Importantly, our evaluation framework shows better alignment with human preferences and transferability across audio tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Training-free Alignment of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09016v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Silicon Minds versus Human Hearts: The Wisdom of Crowds Beats the Wisdom of AI in Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08830v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants. Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence, human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

However, their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop. Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered, part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a 55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Agent: Optimizing Planning Capability for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08816v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics. However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark. This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions. Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods while reducing redundant searches by 37%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing Memory-Augmented AR Agents for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Personalized Task Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08774v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing, (2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3) Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and (4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[RemoteReasoner: Towards Unifying Geospatial Reasoning Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19280v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data, necessitating sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it should autonomously explore and construct its own inference paths, rather than being confined to predefined ground-truth sequences. Ideally, its architecture ought to be unified yet generalized, possessing capabilities to perform diverse reasoning tasks through one model without requiring additional fine-tuning. Existing remote sensing approaches rely on supervised fine-tuning paradigms and task-specific heads, limiting both autonomous reasoning and unified generalization. To this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a unified workflow for geospatial reasoning. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing targets, together with task transformation strategies that enable multi-granularity tasks, including object-, region-, and pixel-level. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient reasoning autonomy. At the inference stage, our transformation strategies enable diverse task output formats without requiring task-specific decoders or further fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrated that RemoteReasoner achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multi-granularity reasoning tasks. Furthermore, it retains the MLLM's inherent generalization capability, demonstrating robust performance on unseen tasks and out-of-distribution categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multilingual Multimodal LLMs With Cultural Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07414v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages. We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities. CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DocThinker: Explainable Multimodal Large Language Models with Rule-based Reinforcement Learning for Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08589v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial, and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks. In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly improves generalization while producing more explainable and human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based document understanding.

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, 38 pages, 22 figures, 35 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Effective MLLM Jailbreaking Through Balanced On-Topicness and OOD-Intensity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09218v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off: highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content. However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD). The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-ORMLLM: Improve Spatial Relation Understanding in the Operating Room with Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08199v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedReasoner: Reinforcement Learning Drives Reasoning Grounding from Clinical Thought to Pixel-Level Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08177v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</p></details> | 37 pages |

Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages for the main paper</p></details> |

However, training these models requires large-scale datasets, which brings challenges related to efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of web data. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a new data synthesis and curation method for generating image-caption pairs. Unlike traditional methods, where captions are generated from images, SynthVLM utilizes advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to synthesize and select images from text captions, thereby creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. We further introduce SynthVLM-100K, a high-quality dataset consisting of 100K curated and synthesized image-caption pairs. In both model and human evaluations, SynthVLM-100K outperforms traditional real-world datasets. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B, which achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various vision question-answering (VQA) tasks. Notably, our models outperform LLaVA across most metrics with only 18\% pretrain data. Furthermore, SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B attain SOTA performance on the MMLU benchmark, demonstrating that the high-quality SynthVLM-100K dataset preserves language abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, we identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness. This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and (III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety, reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

It has been shown to influence human perception and decision-making, often leading to biased judgments that favor those deemed attractive in what is referred to as the "attractiveness halo effect". While extensively studied in human judgments in a broad set of domains, including hiring, judicial sentencing or credit granting, the role that attractiveness plays in the assessments and decisions made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is unknown. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study with 7 diverse open-source MLLMs evaluated on 91 socially relevant scenarios and a diverse dataset of 924 face images - corresponding to 462 individuals both with and without beauty filters applied to them. Our analysis reveals that attractiveness impacts the decisions made by MLLMs in 86.2% of the scenarios on average, demonstrating substantial bias in model behavior in what we refer to as an attractiveness bias. Similarly to humans, we find empirical evidence of the existence of the attractiveness halo effect in 94.8% of the relevant scenarios: attractive individuals are more likely to be attributed positive traits, such as intelligence or confidence, by MLLMs than unattractive individuals. Furthermore, we uncover gender, age and race biases in a significant portion of the scenarios which are also impacted by attractiveness, particularly in the case of gender, highlighting the intersectional nature of the algorithmic attractiveness bias. Our findings suggest that societal stereotypes and cultural norms intersect with perceptions of attractiveness in MLLMs in a complex manner. Our work emphasizes the need to account for intersectionality in algorithmic bias detection and mitigation efforts and underscores the challenges of addressing biases in modern MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 4 figures, 33 tables; Accepted for publication at the Eighth AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics and Society (AIES 2025) (https://www.aies-conference.com/2025/)</p></details> |
| **[Segmenting and Understanding: Region-aware Semantic Attention for Fine-grained Image Quality Assessment with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07818v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However, existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations. To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition, RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.</p></details> |  |

In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems, enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent. However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters, suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V.

Despite the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods can adapt for this dual heterogeneity, they still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and forward forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped Mixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the pre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows in this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and introduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by the increasing routing complexity. Meanwhile, we design an inter-group routing policy based on task identifiers and task prototype distance, which dynamically selects relevant expert groups and combines their outputs to enhance inter-task collaboration. Secondly, to get the correct task identifiers, we leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which own powerful multimodal comprehension capabilities to generate semantic task descriptions and recognize the correct task identifier. Finally, to mitigate forward forgetting, we dynamically fuse outputs for unseen samples from the frozen CLIP model and TRGE adapter based on training progress, leveraging both pre-trained and learned knowledge. Through extensive experiments across various settings, our method outperforms other advanced methods with fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and \textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by \textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution multimodal benchmarks.

Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while robust, often face obstacles due to content-shallow encoding limitations and lack of structural awareness, necessitating hand-crafted modifications for effective application. In this work, we introduce an original framework, visual evolutionary ptimization (VEO), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as the backbone evolutionary optimizer in this context. Specifically, we propose a context-aware encoding way, representing the solution of the network as an image. In this manner, we can utilize MLLMs' image processing capabilities to intuitively comprehend network configurations, thus enabling machines to solve these problems in a human-like way. We have developed MLLM-based operators tailored for various evolutionary optimization stages, including initialization, crossover, and mutation. Furthermore, we propose that graph sparsification can effectively enhance the applicability and scalability of VEO on large-scale networks, owing to the scale-free nature of real-world networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a well-known task in complex networks, influence maximization, and validate it on eight different real-world networks of various structures. The results have confirmed VEO's reliability and enhanced effectiveness compared to traditional evolutionary optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MME-Emotion: A Holistic Evaluation Benchmark for Emotional Intelligence in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09210v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress, current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and \textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$ recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark. \ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion, we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional intelligence in the future.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA methods demonstrate stronger perceptual and generalization capabilities compared to traditional approaches, yet they suffer from modality bias (score-only or text-only) and lack fine-grained attribute decomposition, thereby failing to support further aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we present:(1) ArtiMuse, an innovative MLLM-based IAA model with Joint Scoring and Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with 8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score. Both the model and dataset will be made public to advance the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 31 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

This difficulty arises primarily from the scarcity of datasets with sufficiently rich and domain-specific annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce FineBadminton, a novel and large-scale dataset featuring a unique multi-level semantic annotation hierarchy (Foundational Actions, Tactical Semantics, and Decision Evaluation) for comprehensive badminton understanding. The construction of FineBadminton is powered by an innovative annotation pipeline that synergistically combines MLLM-generated proposals with human refinement. We also present FBBench, a challenging benchmark derived from FineBadminton, to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on nuanced spatio-temporal reasoning and tactical comprehension. Together, FineBadminton and FBBench provide a crucial ecosystem to catalyze research in fine-grained video understanding and advance the development of MLLMs in sports intelligence. Furthermore, we propose an optimized baseline approach incorporating Hit-Centric Keyframe Selection to focus on pivotal moments and Coordinate-Guided Condensation to distill salient visual information. The results on FBBench reveal that while current MLLMs still face significant challenges in deep sports video analysis, our proposed strategies nonetheless achieve substantial performance gains.

| **[CoT-Pose: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for 3D Pose Generation from Abstract Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07540v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract (high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.</p></details> | ICCVW'25 |

In particular, visual-textual mathematical reasoning serves as a key indicator of an MLLM's ability to comprehend and solve complex, multi-step quantitative problems. While existing benchmarks such as MathVista and MathVerse have advanced the evaluation of multimodal math proficiency, they primarily rely on digitally rendered content and fall short in capturing the complexity of real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathScape, a novel benchmark focused on assessing MLLMs' reasoning ability in realistic mathematical contexts. MathScape comprises 1,369 high-quality math problems paired with human-captured real-world images, closely reflecting the challenges encountered in practical educational settings. We conduct a thorough multi-dimensional evaluation across nine leading closed-source MLLMs, three open-source MLLMs with over 20 billion parameters, and seven smaller-scale MLLMs. Our results show that even SOTA models struggle with real-world math tasks, lagging behind human performance -- highlighting critical limitations in current model capabilities. Moreover, we find that strong performance on synthetic or digitally rendered images does not guarantee similar effectiveness on real-world tasks. This underscores the necessity of MathScape in the next stage of multimodal mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents. Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables), offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.</p></details> | Under Review |

Prior works achieved personalization by merging corresponding low-rank adapters (LoRAs) through optimization-based methods, which are computationally demanding and unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. To address this, we introduce LoRA$.$rar, a method that not only improves image quality but also achieves a remarkable speedup of over $4000\times$ in the merging process. We collect a dataset of style and subject LoRAs and pre-train a hypernetwork on a diverse set of content-style LoRA pairs, learning an efficient merging strategy that generalizes to new, unseen content-style pairs, enabling fast, high-quality personalization. Moreover, we identify limitations in existing evaluation metrics for content-style quality and propose a new protocol using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for more accurate assessment. Our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art in both content and style fidelity, as validated by MLLM assessments and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[LET-US: Long Event-Text Understanding of Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07401v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US, a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features. Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSPO: Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization for Long-form Video Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04369v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. However, building a trainable sampling method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling in Video-MLLMs. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization for the temporal sampling policy. Furthermore, we propose a dual-style long video training data construction pipeline, balancing comprehensive temporal understanding and key segment localization. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hui-design/TSPO</p></details> |  |
| **[DocR1: Evidence Page-Guided GRPO for Multi-Page Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07313v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs, its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework, Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCFQA: A Benchmark for Cross-Lingual and Cross-Modal Speech and Text Factuality Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07295v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ross-lingual and \textbf{C}ross-modal \textbf{F}actuality benchmark (\textbf{CCFQA}). Specifically, the CCFQA benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages, designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yxduir/ccfqa.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods rely on implicit feature fusion modules, making it difficult to model fine-grained recognition patterns under various challenges in real world. Benefiting from the powerful Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the object appearances are effectively translated into descriptive captions. In this paper, we propose a reliable caption generation pipeline based on attribute confidence, which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs and improves the quality of generated text. Additionally, to model diverse identity patterns, we propose a novel ReID framework, named NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification. Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural branches to separately capture fine-grained appearance features and coarse-grained structure features. For semantic recognition, we first propose a Text-Modulated Semantic Experts (TMSE), which randomly samples high-quality captions to modulate experts capturing semantic features and mining inter-modality complementary cues. Second, to recognize structure features, we propose a Context-Shared Structure Experts (CSSE), which focuses on the holistic object structure and maintains identity structural consistency via a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose a Multi-Grained Features Aggregation (MGFA), which adopts a unified fusion strategy to effectively integrate multi-grained experts into the final identity representations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that it significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding the Multimodal Mind: Generalizable Brain-to-Text Translation via Multimodal Alignment and Adaptive Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10356v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding language from the human brain remains a grand challenge for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Current approaches typically rely on unimodal brain representations, neglecting the brain's inherently multimodal processing. Inspired by the brain's associative mechanisms, where viewing an image can evoke related sounds and linguistic representations, we propose a unified framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to align brain signals with a shared semantic space encompassing text, images, and audio. A router module dynamically selects and fuses modality-specific brain features according to the characteristics of each stimulus. Experiments on various fMRI datasets with textual, visual, and auditory stimuli demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving an 8.48% improvement on the most commonly used benchmark. We further extend our framework to EEG and MEG data, demonstrating flexibility and robustness across varying temporal and spatial resolutions. To our knowledge, this is the first unified BCI architecture capable of robustly decoding multimodal brain activity across diverse brain signals and stimulus types, offering a flexible solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, their large parameter sizes and substantial computational demands severely hinder their practical deployment and application.While quantization is an effective way to reduce model size and inference latency, its application to MLLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Conventional quantization often struggles with MLLMs because of (a) high inference latency from large visual token counts, (b) distributional disparities between visual and textual tokens, and (c) extreme outliers introduced by Hadamard-based transformations. To address these issues, MQuant introduces: Modality-Specific Static Quantization (MSQ), assigning distinct static scales for visual vs. textual tokens; Attention-Invariant Flexible Switching (AIFS), reordering tokens to preserve casual attention while eliminating expensive token-wise scale computations; Rotation Magnitude Suppression (RMS), mitigating weight outliers arising from online Hadamard rotations. On five mainstream MLLMs (including Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, CogVLM2), MQuant under W4A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (<1% degradation) while reducing inference latency by up to 30%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ baselines. Our MQuant effectively bridges the gap for efficient and accurate MLLMs inference in resource-constrained devices. Code has been released in https://github.com/StiphyJay/MQuant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025.

While increasing the number of sampled frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution. Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective, still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding authors: Weiyu Guo, Hui Xiong This manuscript is a preprint.

Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE for enhancing GUI agents at both training and inference. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a continuous reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a ``Simple Thinking'' reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a cropping-based resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present decomposed grounding with selection to dramatically improve grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art grounding performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 while it also exhibits strong general agent capabilities. For instance, using both our training and inference enhancement methods brings 23\% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro. We provide the code in https://github.com/KDEGroup/UI-AGILE.</p></details> |  |
