| **[Your VAR Model is Secretly an Efficient and Explainable Generative Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12060v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveletDiff: Multilevel Wavelet Diffusion For Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11839v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting, classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation; however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$ smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vicinity-Guided Discriminative Latent Diffusion for Privacy-Preserving Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00478v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks for Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10211v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently, prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03016v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs. Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels, will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperspectral data augmentation with transformer-based diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08363v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales. However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work, we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model, which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep generative models for data augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, accepted at SPIE REMOTE SENSING conference 16-20 September 2024 Edinburgh, United Kingdom</p></details> |
| **[LinVideo: A Post-Training Framework towards O(n) Attention in Efficient Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08318v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |
| **[MAMBO: High-Resolution Generative Approach for Mammography Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08677v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection. The source code used in this study is publicly available at: https://github.com/iai-rs/mambo.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[What Lurks Within? Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14815v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content. Despite increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but they suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled models trained with curated concept datasets and 771 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. Evaluation results show that PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18 - 40X compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted at CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bidirectional Mammogram View Translation with Column-Aware and Implicit 3D Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04947v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings, demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM2...</summary><p>BIBM2025 accept, 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Unified Geometry Understanding: Riemannian Diffusion Framework for Graph Generation and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04522v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph diffusion models have made significant progress in learning structured graph data and have demonstrated strong potential for predictive tasks. Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential. To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with the manifold signature. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance across a variety of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeuIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Cloud-Based Diffusion-Guided Hybrid Model for High-Accuracy Accident Detection in Intelligent Transportation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03675v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings, allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models, our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing. Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques, timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an accuracy of 97.32%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Autoregressive Models are Laplacian, Discrete, and Latent Diffusion Models in Disguise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02826v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space, casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffusionBlocks: Block-wise Neural Network Training via Diffusion Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14202v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end backpropagation requires storing activations throughout all layers, creating memory bottlenecks that limit model scalability. Existing block-wise training methods offer means to alleviate this problem, but they rely on ad-hoc local objectives and remain largely unexplored beyond classification tasks. We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a principled framework for transforming transformer-based networks into genuinely independent trainable blocks that maintain competitive performance with end-to-end training. Our key insight leverages the fact that residual connections naturally correspond to updates in a dynamical system. With minimal modifications to this system, we can convert the updates to those of a denoising process, where each block can be learned independently by leveraging the score matching objective. This independence enables training with gradients for only one block at a time, thereby reducing memory requirements in proportion to the number of blocks. Our experiments on a range of transformer architectures (vision, diffusion, autoregressive, recurrent-depth, and masked diffusion) demonstrate that DiffusionBlocks training matches the performance of end-to-end training while enabling scalable block-wise training on practical tasks beyond small-scale classification. DiffusionBlocks provides a theoretically grounded approach that successfully scales to modern generative tasks across diverse architectures.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii) reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data. In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task. Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch, showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the memory cost and sampling time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Weight Parameters for Training Data Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05647v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study gradient-based data attribution, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods for this task either treat network parameters uniformly or rely on implicit weighting derived from Hessian approximations, which do not fully model functional heterogeneity of network parameters. To address this, we propose a method to explicitly learn parameter importance weights directly from data, without requiring annotated labels. Our approach improves attribution accuracy across diverse tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and diffusion, and enables fine-grained attribution for concepts like subject and style.</p></details> |  |
| **[User to Video: A Model for Spammer Detection Inspired by Video Classification Technology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06233v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e., WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Authentic Discrete Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations validate the measurable gains of each component.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZQBA: Zero Query Black-box Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00769v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world contexts. All the source code is available at https://github.com/Joana-Cabral/ZQBA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICAART Conference</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19078v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CINDES: Classification induced neural density estimator and simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00367v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network-based methods for (un)conditional density estimation have recently gained substantial attention, as various neural density estimators have outperformed classical approaches in real-data experiments. Despite these empirical successes, implementation can be challenging due to the need to ensure non-negativity and unit-mass constraints, and theoretical understanding remains limited. In particular, it is unclear whether such estimators can adaptively achieve faster convergence rates when the underlying density exhibits a low-dimensional structure. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a structure-agnostic neural density estimator that is (i) straightforward to implement and (ii) provably adaptive, attaining faster rates when the true density admits a low-dimensional composition structure. Another key contribution of our work is to show that the proposed estimator integrates naturally into generative sampling pipelines, most notably score-based diffusion models, where it achieves provably faster convergence when the underlying density is structured. We validate its performance through extensive simulations and a real-data application.</p></details> | 50 pages, 1 figure |

We show that concepts such as simultaneous and ensemble controllability offer new insights into the classification and representation properties of deep neural networks while the control and optimization of static systems can be employed to better understand the performance of shallow networks. Inspired by the classical concept of turnpike, we also explore the relationship between dynamic and static neural networks, where depth is traded for width, and the role of transformers as mechanisms for accelerating classical neural network tasks. We also exploit the expressive power of neural networks (exemplified, for instance, by the Universal Approximation Theorem) to develop a novel hybrid modeling methodology, the Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), combining mechanics and data-driven methods in a game-theoretic setting. Finally, we describe how classical properties of diffusion processes, long established in the context of partial differential equations, contribute to explaining the success of modern generative artificial intelligence (AI). We present an overview of our recent results in these areas, illustrating how control, machine learning, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations come together to motivate a fertile ground for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCDance: Genre-Controlled Music-Driven 3D Full Body Dance Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18309v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music-driven dance generation is a challenging task as it requires strict adherence to genre-specific choreography while ensuring physically realistic and precisely synchronized dance sequences with the music's beats and rhythm. Although significant progress has been made in music-conditioned dance generation, most existing methods struggle to convey specific stylistic attributes in generated dance. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based framework for genre-specific 3D full-body dance generation, conditioned on both music and descriptive text. To effectively incorporate genre information, we develop a text-based control mechanism that maps input prompts, either explicit genre labels or free-form descriptive text, into genre-specific control signals, enabling precise and controllable text-guided generation of genre-consistent dance motions. Furthermore, to enhance the alignment between music and textual conditions, we leverage the features of a music foundation model, facilitating coherent and semantically aligned dance synthesis. Last, to balance the objectives of extracting text-genre information and maintaining high-quality generation results, we propose a novel multi-task optimization strategy. This effectively balances competing factors such as physical realism, spatial accuracy, and text classification, significantly improving the overall quality of the generated sequences. Extensive experimental results obtained on the FineDance and AIST++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCDance over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Preprocessing Unit for Effective Deep Learning based Classification and Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24497v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is crucial as it allows for timely intervention, preventing vision loss and enabling effective management of diabetic complications. This research performs detection of DR and DME at an early stage through the proposed framework which includes three stages: preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In the preprocessing stage, noise filtering is performed by fuzzy filtering, artefact removal is performed by non-linear diffusion filtering, and the contrast improvement is performed by a novel filter called Adaptive Variable Distance Speckle (AVDS) filter. The AVDS filter employs four distance calculation methods such as Euclidean, Bhattacharya, Manhattan, and Hamming. The filter adaptively chooses a distance method which produces the highest contrast value amongst all 3 methods. From the analysis, hamming distance method was found to achieve better results for contrast and Euclidean distance showing less error value with high PSNR. The segmentation stage is performed using Improved Mask-Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask RCNN). In the final stage, feature extraction and classification using novel Self-Spatial Attention infused VGG-16 (SSA-VGG-16), which effectively captures both global contextual relationships and critical spatial regions within retinal images, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of DR and DME detection and grading. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using two distinct datasets: IDRiD and MESSIDOR.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMix: Effective Data Augmentation with Generative Diffusion Model Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02366v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is widely used to enhance generalization in visual classification tasks. However, traditional methods struggle when source and target domains differ, as in domain adaptation, due to their inability to address domain gaps. This paper introduces GenMix, a generalizable prompt-guided generative data augmentation approach that enhances both in-domain and cross-domain image classification. Our technique leverages image editing to generate augmented images based on custom conditional prompts, designed specifically for each problem type. By blending portions of the input image with its edited generative counterpart and incorporating fractal patterns, our approach mitigates unrealistic images and label ambiguity, improving the performance and adversarial robustness of the resulting models. Efficacy of our method is established with extensive experiments on eight public datasets for general and fine-grained classification, in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Additionally, we demonstrate performance improvements for self-supervised learning, learning with data scarcity, and adversarial robustness. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, our technique achieves stronger performance across the board.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://diffusemix.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[DiffInk: Glyph- and Style-Aware Latent Diffusion Transformer for Text to Online Handwriting Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23624v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation (TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled. We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Gaussian Universality for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07741v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate Gaussian Universality for data distributions generated via diffusion models. By Gaussian Universality we mean that the test error of a generalized linear model $f(\mathbf{W})$ trained for a classification task on the diffusion data matches the test error of $f(\mathbf{W})$ trained on the Gaussian Mixture with matching means and covariances per class.In other words, the test error depends only on the first and second order statistics of the diffusion-generated data in the linear setting. As a corollary, the analysis of the test error for linear classifiers can be reduced to Gaussian data from diffusion-generated data. Analysing the performance of models trained on synthetic data is a pertinent problem due to the surge of methods such as \cite{sehwag2024stretchingdollardiffusiontraining}. Moreover, we show that, for any $1$- Lipschitz scalar function $\phi$, $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ is close to $\mathbb{E} \phi(\mathbf{x})$ with high probability for $\mathbf{x}$ sampled from the conditional diffusion model corresponding to each class. Finally, we note that current approaches for proving universality do not apply to diffusion-generated data as the covariance matrices of the data tend to have vanishing minimum singular values, contrary to the assumption made in the literature. This leaves extending previous mathematical universality results as an intriguing open question.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balanced Diffusion-Guided Fusion for Multimodal Remote Sensing Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23310v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However, pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/BDGF.</p></details> |  |
| **[More Data or Better Algorithms: Latent Diffusion Augmentation for Deep Imbalanced Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23240v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed, and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Synthetic Replays: Turning Diffusion Features into Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23402v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data while requiring models to acquire new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. Recent works have explored generative models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), to address these challenges. However, existing approaches use SD mainly as a replay generator, whereas we demonstrate that SD's rich multi-scale representations can serve as a unified backbone. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Diffusion-FSCIL, which extracts four synergistic feature types from SD by capturing real image characteristics through inversion, providing semantic diversity via class-conditioned synthesis, enhancing generalization through controlled noise injection, and enabling replay without image storage through generative features. Unlike conventional approaches requiring synthetic buffers and separate classification backbones, our unified framework operates entirely in the latent space with only lightweight networks ($\approx$6M parameters). Extensive experiments on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with comprehensive ablations confirming the necessity of each feature type. Furthermore, we confirm that our streamlined variant maintains competitive accuracy while substantially improving efficiency, establishing the viability of generative models as practical and effective backbones for FSCIL.</p></details> | pre-print ver 2 |

To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0 model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0 achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58 percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI 2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches have explored generating synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025.

While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV2025. 22 pages, including references and appendix.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 37 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

Within this framework, we establish identifiability conditions for general disentangled latent variable models, analyze training dynamics, and derive sample complexity bounds for disentangled latent subspace models. To validate our theory, we conduct disentanglement experiments across diverse tasks and modalities, including subspace recovery in latent subspace Gaussian mixture models, image colorization, image denoising, and voice conversion for speech classification. Additionally, our experiments show that training strategies inspired by our theory, such as style guidance regularization, consistently enhance disentanglement performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025)</p></details> |

However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to further spread the infection. While final statuses are hidden, intermediate indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide useful representations of the underlying diffusion process. We propose a partial observability-aware Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model. We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. Through extensive benchmarking against Approximate Bayesian Computation and GNN-based baselines, our framework consistently outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering accurate parameter estimates across diverse diffusion settings while scaling efficiently to large networks. We validate the method on synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world insider trading network, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual statuses is not possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Classifier-Driven Reward for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01143v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) mitigates the need for reward definition, aligning with human preferences via preference-driven reward feedback without interacting with the environment. However, trajectory-wise preference labels are difficult to meet the precise learning of step-wise reward, thereby affecting the performance of downstream algorithms. To alleviate the insufficient step-wise reward caused by trajectory-wise preferences, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). DPR directly treats step-wise preference-based reward acquisition as a binary classification and utilizes the robustness of diffusion classifiers to infer step-wise rewards discriminatively. In addition, to further utilize trajectory-wise preference information, we propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which conditions on trajectory-wise preference labels to enhance reward inference. We apply the above methods to existing offline RL algorithms, and a series of experimental results demonstrate that the diffusion classifier-driven reward outperforms the previous reward acquisition method with the Bradley-Terry model.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and $2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction builds on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes -- namely, the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET -- which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar--Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). Both the $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs adopt a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN), cascading the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation -- akin to local pooling in CNNs -- that can be performed either locally or per scale. Such pooling operations are more difficult to define in traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets and in geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, our approach extracts a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be combined with simple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification with far fewer trainable parameters than most modern graph neural networks require. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MHSNs on three distinct problem types: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |
| **[Elucidating the Design Space of FP4 training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17791v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of foundation models have spurred research into low-precision training, with 4-bit floating-point (\texttt{FP4}) formats emerging as a frontier for maximizing hardware throughput. While numerous techniques have been proposed to stabilize \texttt{FP4} training, they often present isolated solutions with varying, and not always clear, computational overheads. This paper aims to provide a unified view of the design space of \texttt{FP4} training. We introduce a comprehensive, quantisation gradient-based framework for microscaling quantization that allows for a theoretical analysis of the computational costs associated with different stabilization methods on both the forward and backward passes. Using a simulator built on this framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, image classification, diffusion models, and language models. By systematically evaluating thousands of combinations of techniques, such as novel gradient approximations, rounding strategies, and scaling methods, we identify which configurations offer the most favourable performance-to-overhead trade-off. We find that the techniques enabling the best trade-off involve carefully combining Hadamard transformations, tensor scaling and stochastic rounding. We further find that using \texttt{UE5M3} as a scaling factor potentially offers a good compromise between range and precision with manageable computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Edge-Specific Node Features through Co-Representation Neural Hypergraph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14286v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs are widely being employed to represent complex higher-order relations in real-world applications. Most existing research on hypergraph learning focuses on node-level or edge-level tasks. A practically relevant and more challenging task, edge-dependent node classification (ENC), is still under-explored. In ENC, a node can have different labels across different hyperedges, which requires the modeling of node features unique to each hyperedge. The state-of-the-art ENC solution, WHATsNet, only outputs single node and edge representations, leading to the limitations of \textbf{entangled edge-specific features} and \textbf{non-adaptive representation sizes} when applied to ENC. Additionally, WHATsNet suffers from the common \textbf{oversmoothing issue} in most HGNNs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoNHD}, a novel HGNN architecture specifically designed to model edge-specific features for ENC. Instead of learning separate representations for nodes and edges, CoNHD reformulates within-edge and within-node interactions as a hypergraph diffusion process over node-edge co-representations. We develop a neural implementation of the proposed diffusion process, leveraging equivariant networks as diffusion operators to effectively learn the diffusion dynamics from data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoNHD achieves the best performance across all benchmark ENC datasets and several downstream tasks without sacrificing efficiency. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/zhengyijia/CoNHD.</p></details> |  |

The framework integrates multi-task learning (MTL), GPT-based sentiment analysis, and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) propagation modeling. The study examines limitations in existing approaches. It models static production attributes, information dissemination, and audience sentiment at the same time. The framework uses 5,840 films from 2004 to 2024 and approximate 300,000 user reviews. It shows predictive performance with classification accuracy of 0.964 and regression metrics of MAE 0.388. Ablation analysis indicates component interactions. Selective feature combinations perform better than the comprehensive model. This result questions assumptions about feature integration. The model shows virality patterns between successful and unsuccessful films. Innovations include epidemiological modeling for information diffusion, multidimensional sentiment features from GPT-based analysis, and a shared representation architecture that optimizes multiple success metrics. The framework provides applications in the film production lifecycle. It also contributes to understanding how audience engagement leads to commercial outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved mmFormer for Liver Fibrosis Staging via Missing-Modality Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16436v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world clinical settings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently suffers from missing modalities due to equipment variability or patient cooperation issues, which can significantly affect model performance. To address this issue, we propose a multimodal MRI classification model based on the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module for handling arbitrary combinations of missing modalities. Specifically, this model retains the hybrid modality-specific encoders and the modality-correlated encoder from mmFormer to extract consistent lesion features across available modalities. In addition, we integrate a missing-modality compensation module which leverages zero-padding, modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical parameters to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing information. To further improve prediction performance, we adopt a cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different folds and applying soft voting during inference. This method is evaluated on the test set of Comprehensive Analysis & Computing of REal-world medical images (CARE) 2025 challenge, targeting the Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) task based on non-contrast dynamic MRI scans including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For Cirrhosis Detection and Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, our model obtains accuracies of 66.67%, and 74.17%, and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Cross-Modal Feature Extraction for Multi-Label Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15553v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce \textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that \textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

| **[Random Matrix Theory-guided sparse PCA for single-cell RNA-seq data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15429v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.</p></details> | 16 figures |

We investigate claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack. This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were found and discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages article, 29 pdf pages, 19 figures, MLRC.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on direct brain-image feature alignment and are limited to single-task frameworks or task-specific models. In this paper, we propose a Unified MultItask Network for zero-shot M/EEG visual Decoding (referred to UMind), including visual stimulus retrieval, classification, and reconstruction, where multiple tasks mutually enhance each other. Our method learns robust neural-visual and semantic representations through multimodal alignment with both image and text modalities. The integration of both coarse and fine-grained texts enhances the extraction of these neural representations, enabling more detailed semantic and visual decoding. These representations then serve as dual conditional inputs to a pre-trained diffusion model, guiding visual reconstruction from both visual and semantic perspectives. Extensive evaluations on MEG and EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and biological plausibility of our approach in capturing spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Our approach sets a multitask pipeline for brain visual decoding, highlighting the synergy of semantic information in visual feature extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Reinforcement Learning-Guided Diffusion Model for Image Synthesis via Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Model Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14163v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models typically employ static or heuristic classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules, which often fail to adapt across timesteps and noise conditions. In this work, we introduce a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) controller that dynamically adjusts CFG at each denoising step. The controller adopts a hybrid quantum--classical actor--critic architecture: a shallow variational quantum circuit (VQC) with ring entanglement generates policy features, which are mapped by a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP) into Gaussian actions over $\Delta$CFG, while a classical critic estimates value functions. The policy is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), guided by a reward that balances classification confidence, perceptual improvement, and action regularization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our QRL policy improves perceptual quality (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) while reducing parameter count compared to classical RL actors and fixed schedules. Ablation studies on qubit number and circuit depth reveal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and extended evaluations confirm robust generation under long diffusion schedules.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecDiff: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Self-Speculation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13848v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff} achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information, \textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolvable Graph Diffusion Optimal Transport with Pattern-Specific Alignment for Brain Connectome Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16238v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network analysis of human brain connectivity indicates that individual differences in cognitive abilities arise from neurobiological mechanisms inherent in structural and functional brain networks. Existing studies routinely treat structural connectivity (SC) as optimal or fixed topological scaffolds for functional connectivity (FC), often overlooking higher-order dependencies between brain regions and limiting the modeling of complex cognitive processes. Besides, the distinct spatial organizations of SC and FC complicate direct integration, as naive alignment may distort intrinsic nonlinear patterns of brain connectivity. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Evolvable Graph Diffusion Optimal Transport with Pattern-Specific Alignment (EDT-PA), designed to identify disease-specific connectome patterns and classify brain disorders. To accurately model high-order structural dependencies, EDT-PA incorporates a spectrum of evolvable modeling blocks to dynamically capture high-order dependencies across brain regions. Additionally, a Pattern-Specific Alignment mechanism employs optimal transport to align structural and functional representations in a geometry-aware manner. By incorporating a Kolmogorov-Arnold network for flexible node aggregation, EDT-PA is capable of modeling complex nonlinear interactions among brain regions for downstream classification. Extensive evaluations on the REST-meta-MDD and ADNI datasets demonstrate that EDT-PA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a more effective framework for revealing structure-function misalignments and disorder-specific subnetworks in brain disorders. The project of this work is released via this link.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these scales are chosen to be dyadic integers, $2^j$. Here, we propose a novel, unsupervised method for selecting the diffusion scales based on ideas from information theory. We then show that our method can be incorporated into wavelet-based GNNs, which are modeled after the geometric scattering transform, via graph classification experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAG: Data Reconstruction Attack using Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11724v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms for large models in SI scenarios.

We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and food safety monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeeDiff: Off-the-Shelf Seeded Mask Generation from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19808v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Robustifying Diffusion-Denoised Smoothing Against Covariate Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10913v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results. However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ahedayat/Robustifying-DDS-Against-Covariate-Shift</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at: https://github.com/yurujaja/SatDiFuser.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, camera ready</p></details> |

Existing tabular generation approaches, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), typically require sufficient reference data, limiting their effectiveness in domain-specific databases with scarce records. While prompt-based LLMs offer flexibility without parameter tuning, they often fail to capture dataset-specific feature-label dependencies and generate redundant data, leading to degradation in downstream task performance. To overcome these issues, we propose ReFine, a framework that (i) derives symbolic "if-then" rules from interpretable models and embeds them into prompts to explicitly guide generation toward domain-specific feature distribution, and (ii) applies a dual-granularity filtering strategy that suppresses over-sampling patterns and selectively refines rare but informative samples to reduce distributional imbalance. Extensive experiments on various regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that ReFine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 0.44 absolute improvement in R-squared for regression and 10.0 percent relative improvement in F1 score for classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis.

| **[LLaDA-VLA: Vision Language Diffusion Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06932v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMS-Net:Dual-Modal Multi-Scale Siamese Network for Binocular Fundus Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18046v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ophthalmic diseases pose a significant global health burden. However, traditional diagnostic methods and existing monocular image-based deep learning approaches often overlook the pathological correlations between the two eyes. In practical medical robotic diagnostic scenarios, paired retinal images (binocular fundus images) are frequently required as diagnostic evidence. To address this, we propose DMS-Net-a dual-modal multi-scale siamese network for binocular retinal image classification. The framework employs a weight-sharing siamese ResNet-152 architecture to concurrently extract deep semantic features from bilateral fundus images. To tackle challenges like indistinct lesion boundaries and diffuse pathological distributions, we introduce the OmniPool Spatial Integrator Module (OSIM), which achieves multi-resolution feature aggregation through multi-scale adaptive pooling and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the Calibrated Analogous Semantic Fusion Module (CASFM) leverages spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention mechanisms to enhance cross-modal interaction, aggregating modality-agnostic representations of fundus structures. To fully exploit the differential semantic information of lesions present in bilateral fundus features, we introduce the Cross-Modal Contrastive Alignment Module (CCAM). Additionally, to enhance the aggregation of lesion-correlated semantic information, we introduce the Cross-Modal Integrative Alignment Module (CIAM). Evaluation on the ODIR-5K dataset demonstrates that DMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 82.9%, recall of 84.5%, and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 83.2%, showcasing robust capacity in detecting symmetrical pathologies and improving clinical decision-making for ocular diseases. Code and the processed dataset will be released subsequently.</p></details> |  |

However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.</p></details> |  |

We propose a framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI 2025)</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments.

| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  |

Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning for LiDAR-Based Indoor Surface Classification in Intelligent Wireless Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03813v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories, using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior. A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity, including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio, were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.</p></details> |  |

While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g., camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data. We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEGDM: EEG Representation Learning via Generative Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14086v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as the model size increases. In this work, we proposed an EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained it using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) framework. Subsequently, the resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used multi-event datasets covering both interictal epileptiform discharges (TUEV) and seizure (CHB-MIT) detection, and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed the existing methods. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our source code and checkpoint are available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EEGDM...</summary><p>EEGDM Preprint 10 Pages</p></details> |

Representative data augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods.

| **[Towards High-Fidelity and Controllable Bioacoustic Generation via Enhanced Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00318v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling offers new opportunities for bioacoustics, enabling the synthesis of realistic animal vocalizations that could support biomonitoring efforts and supplement scarce data for endangered species. However, directly generating bird call waveforms from noisy field recordings remains a major challenge. We propose BirdDiff, a generative framework designed to synthesize bird calls from a noisy dataset of 12 wild bird species. The model incorporates a "zeroth layer" stage for multi-scale adaptive bird-call enhancement, followed by a diffusion-based generator conditioned on three modalities: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, species labels, and textual descriptions. The enhancement stage improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing spectral distortion, achieving the highest SNR gain (+10.45 dB) and lowest Itakura-Saito Distance (0.54) compared to three widely used non-training enhancement methods. We evaluate BirdDiff against a baseline generative model, DiffWave. Our method yields substantial improvements in generative quality metrics: Fr\'echet Audio Distance (0.590 to 0.213), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (0.259 to 0.226), and Number of Statistically-Different Bins (7.33 to 5.58). To assess species-specific detail preservation, we use a ResNet50 classifier trained on the original dataset to identify generated samples. Classification accuracy improves from 35.9% (DiffWave) to 70.1% (BirdDiff), with 8 of 12 species exceeding 70% accuracy. These results demonstrate that BirdDiff enables high-fidelity, controllable bird call generation directly from noisy field recordings.</p></details> |  |

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19151v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</p></details> | 55 pages, 10 figures |

To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our synthetic images.

| **[A Novel Local Focusing Mechanism for Deepfake Detection Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17029v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains (e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories, especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP) compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP) module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789 FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in https://github.com/lmlpy/LFM.git</p></details> |  |

Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning, facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions, we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a 6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models, compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical deep learning under real-world data constraints.

| **[CCD: Continual Consistency Diffusion for Lifelong Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11936v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based models have shown remarkable generative capabilities in static settings, their extension to continual learning (CL) scenarios remains fundamentally constrained by Generative Catastrophic Forgetting (GCF). We observe that even with a rehearsal buffer, new generative skills often overwrite previous ones, degrading performance on earlier tasks. Although some initial efforts have explored this space, most rely on heuristics borrowed from continual classification methods or use trained diffusion models as ad hoc replay generators, lacking a principled, unified solution to mitigating GCF and often conducting experiments under fragmented and inconsistent settings. To address this gap, we introduce the Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG), a structured pipeline that redefines how diffusion models are implemented under CL and enables systematic evaluation of GCF. Beyond the empirical pipeline, we propose the first theoretical foundation for CDG, grounded in a cross-task analysis of diffusion-specific generative dynamics. Our theoretical investigation identifies three fundamental consistency principles essential for preserving knowledge in the rehearsal buffer over time: inter-task knowledge consistency, unconditional knowledge consistency, and prior knowledge consistency. These criteria expose the latent mechanisms through which generative forgetting manifests across sequential tasks. Motivated by these insights, we further propose \textit{Continual Consistency Diffusion} (CCD), a principled training framework that enforces these consistency objectives via hierarchical loss functions: $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{PKC}$. Extensive experiments show that CCD achieves SOTA performance across various benchmarks, especially improving generative metrics in overlapping-task scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Voxel Diffusion Module for Point Cloud 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16069v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing, which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions, submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1) diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization, highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7 mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets.

The release of several public datasets has significantly advanced research in this area, yet many existing methods struggle with data imbalance issues. To address this challenge, this study introduces a data augmentation method, called NucleiMix, which is designed to balance the distribution of nuclei types by increasing the number of rare-type nuclei within datasets. NucleiMix operates in two phases. In the first phase, it identifies candidate locations similar to the surroundings of rare-type nuclei and inserts rare-type nuclei into the candidate locations. In the second phase, it employs a progressive inpainting strategy using a pre-trained diffusion model to seamlessly integrate rare-type nuclei into their new environments in replacement of major-type nuclei or background locations. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of NucleiMix on three public datasets using two popular nuclei instance segmentation models. The results demonstrate the superior ability of NucleiMix to synthesize realistic rare-type nuclei and to enhance the quality of nuclei segmentation and classification in an accurate and robust manner.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose a multimodal MRI classification model based on the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module for handling arbitrary combinations of missing modalities. Specifically, this model retains the hybrid modality-specific encoders and the modality-correlated encoder from mmFormer to extract consistent lesion features across available modalities. In addition, we integrate a missing-modality compensation module which leverages zero-padding, modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical parameters to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing information. To further improve prediction performance, we adopt a cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different folds and applying soft voting during inference. This method is evaluated on the test set of Comprehensive Analysis & Computing of REal-world medical images (CARE) 2025 challenge, targeting the Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) task based on non-contrast dynamic MRI scans including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For Cirrhosis Detection and Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, our model obtains accuracies of 66.67%, and 74.17%, and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMS-Net:Dual-Modal Multi-Scale Siamese Network for Binocular Fundus Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18046v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ophthalmic diseases pose a significant global health burden. However, traditional diagnostic methods and existing monocular image-based deep learning approaches often overlook the pathological correlations between the two eyes. In practical medical robotic diagnostic scenarios, paired retinal images (binocular fundus images) are frequently required as diagnostic evidence. To address this, we propose DMS-Net-a dual-modal multi-scale siamese network for binocular retinal image classification. The framework employs a weight-sharing siamese ResNet-152 architecture to concurrently extract deep semantic features from bilateral fundus images. To tackle challenges like indistinct lesion boundaries and diffuse pathological distributions, we introduce the OmniPool Spatial Integrator Module (OSIM), which achieves multi-resolution feature aggregation through multi-scale adaptive pooling and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the Calibrated Analogous Semantic Fusion Module (CASFM) leverages spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention mechanisms to enhance cross-modal interaction, aggregating modality-agnostic representations of fundus structures. To fully exploit the differential semantic information of lesions present in bilateral fundus features, we introduce the Cross-Modal Contrastive Alignment Module (CCAM). Additionally, to enhance the aggregation of lesion-correlated semantic information, we introduce the Cross-Modal Integrative Alignment Module (CIAM). Evaluation on the ODIR-5K dataset demonstrates that DMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 82.9%, recall of 84.5%, and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 83.2%, showcasing robust capacity in detecting symmetrical pathologies and improving clinical decision-making for ocular diseases. Code and the processed dataset will be released subsequently.</p></details> |  |

We propose a framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI 2025)</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments.

Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs.

ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases.

| **[Pixels Under Pressure: Exploring Fine-Tuning Paradigms for Foundation Models in High-Resolution Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14931v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in diffusion-based foundation models have improved text-to-image generation, yet most efforts have been limited to low-resolution settings. As high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real images.

| **[AI-Augmented Thyroid Scintigraphy for Robust Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00366v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Thyroid scintigraphy plays a vital role in diagnosing a range of thyroid disorders. While deep learning classification models hold significant promise in this domain, their effectiveness is frequently compromised by limited and imbalanced datasets. This study investigates the impact of three data augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a ResNet18 classifier. Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine medical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID). Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context. O+FM+CA yielded the most balanced and robust performance across all classes.

However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

One research focus is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs. However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of explainable models in medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at iMIMIC - Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image Computing workshop MICCAI 2025 Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention</p></details> |

Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025.

However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case subgroup performance.

However, the scarcity of data and the class imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data, contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.</p></details> |  |

However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging. It may pave the way for more accessible and cost-effective advanced diagnostic tools.

However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

| **[Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features for Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23460v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2025</p></details> |

Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</p></details> |

This study focuses on a neuroimaging prediction framework based on both structural and functional neuroimaging data. We propose a next-generation prediction model, \textbf{MultiViT2}, which combines a pretrained representative learning base model with a vision transformer backbone for prediction output. Additionally, we developed a data augmentation module based on the latent diffusion model that enriches input data by generating augmented neuroimaging samples, thereby enhancing predictive performance through reduced overfitting and improved generalizability. We show that MultiViT2 significantly outperforms the first-generation model in schizophrenia classification accuracy and demonstrates strong scalability and portability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Doctor Approved: Generating Medically Accurate Skin Disease Images through AI-Expert Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12323v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.</p></details> |  |

However, existing resources may lack the diversity and accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other areas of medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool for medical AI applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion bridge model for 3D brain image translation between T1w MRI and DTI modalities. Our model learns to generate high-quality DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) images from T1w images and vice versa, enabling cross-modality data augmentation and reducing the need for extensive DTI acquisition. We evaluate our approach using perceptual similarity, pixel-level agreement, and distributional consistency metrics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing anatomical structures and preserving information on white matter integrity. The practical utility of the synthetic data is validated through sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks, where the generated images achieve comparable performance to real data. Our diffusion bridge model offers a promising solution for improving neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical decision-making, with the potential to significantly impact neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels.

However, current research on optimization algorithms in federated learning often focuses on limited datasets and scenarios, primarily centered around natural images, with insufficient comparative experiments in medical contexts. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms in the context of medical imaging. We conduct a fair comparison of classification models trained using various federated learning algorithms across multiple medical imaging datasets. Additionally, we evaluate system performance metrics, such as communication cost and computational efficiency, while considering different federated learning architectures. Our findings show that medical imaging datasets pose substantial challenges for current federated learning optimization algorithms. No single algorithm consistently delivers optimal performance across all medical federated learning scenarios, and many optimization algorithms may underperform when applied to these datasets. Our experiments provide a benchmark and guidance for future research and application of federated learning in medical imaging contexts. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and robust method that combines generative techniques using denoising diffusion probabilistic models with label smoothing to augment datasets, widely enhancing the performance of federated learning on classification tasks across various medical imaging datasets. Our code will be released on GitHub, offering a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for future federated learning studies in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the datasets PAD-UFES-20 for skin cancer and P-NDB-UFES for oral cancer, the diffusion model demonstrated competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.

However, the challenge of noisy labels and limited high-quality datasets remains underexplored. To address this, we establish the first benchmark for noisy labels in Med-VQA by simulating human mislabeling with semantically designed noise types. More importantly, we introduce the DiN framework, which leverages a diffusion model to handle noisy labels in Med-VQA. Unlike the dominant classification-based VQA approaches that directly predict answers, our Answer Diffuser (AD) module employs a coarse-to-fine process, refining answer candidates with a diffusion model for improved accuracy.

However, their application is often hindered by data scarcity, both in terms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a novel application of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to the landmark detection task, specifically addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in x-ray imaging. Our key innovation lies in leveraging DDPMs for self-supervised pre-training in landmark detection, a previously unexplored approach in this domain. This method enables accurate landmark detection with minimal annotated training data (as few as 50 images), surpassing both ImageNet supervised pre-training and traditional self-supervised techniques across three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[FedBiP: Heterogeneous One-Shot Federated Learning with Personalized Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04810v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL), a special decentralized machine learning paradigm, has recently gained significant attention. OSFL requires only a single round of client data or model upload, which reduces communication costs and mitigates privacy threats compared to traditional FL. Despite these promising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data heterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL systems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on large-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these issues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results in significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance degradation in classification models trained on such data. This issue is particularly pronounced in rare domains, such as medical imaging, which are underrepresented in LDM's pretraining data. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the pretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP synthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without compromising the privacy regulations. FedBiP is also the first approach to simultaneously address feature space heterogeneity and client data scarcity in OSFL. Our method is validated through extensive experiments on three OSFL benchmarks with feature space heterogeneity, as well as on challenging medical and satellite image datasets with label heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiP, which substantially outperforms other OSFL methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Flow Matching for Medical Image Synthesis: Bridging the Gap Between Speed and Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00266v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for various medical applications. However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications. Code with checkpoints and a synthetic dataset (beneficial for classification and segmentation) is now available on: https://github.com/milad1378yz/MOTFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable, Multi-modal Wound Infection Classification from Images Augmented with Generated Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20277v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infections in Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) can cause severe complications, including tissue death and limb amputation, highlighting the need for accurate, timely diagnosis. Previous machine learning methods have focused on identifying infections by analyzing wound images alone, without utilizing additional metadata such as medical notes. In this study, we aim to improve infection detection by introducing Synthetic Caption Augmented Retrieval for Wound Infection Detection (SCARWID), a novel deep learning framework that leverages synthetic textual descriptions to augment DFU images. SCARWID consists of two components: (1) Wound-BLIP, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on GPT-4o-generated descriptions to synthesize consistent captions from images; and (2) an Image-Text Fusion module that uses cross-attention to extract cross-modal embeddings from an image and its corresponding Wound-BLIP caption. Infection status is determined by retrieving the top-k similar items from a labeled support set. To enhance the diversity of training data, we utilized a latent diffusion model to generate additional wound images. As a result, SCARWID outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively, for wound infection classification. Displaying the generated captions alongside the wound images and infection detection results enhances interpretability and trust, enabling nurses to align SCARWID outputs with their medical knowledge. This is particularly valuable when wound notes are unavailable or when assisting novice nurses who may find it difficult to identify visual attributes of wound infection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Polyp Detection and Diagnosis through Compositional Prompt-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17951v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern, and early detection through screening plays a critical role in reducing mortality. While deep learning models have shown promise in improving polyp detection, classification, and segmentation, their generalization across diverse clinical environments, particularly with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, remains a challenge. Multi-center datasets like PolypGen have been developed to address these issues, but their collection is costly and time-consuming. Traditional data augmentation techniques provide limited variability, failing to capture the complexity of medical images. Diffusion models have emerged as a promising solution for generating synthetic polyp images, but the image generation process in current models mainly relies on segmentation masks as the condition, limiting their ability to capture the full clinical context. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Progressive Spectrum Diffusion Model (PSDM) that integrates diverse clinical annotations-such as segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and colonoscopy reports-by transforming them into compositional prompts. These prompts are organized into coarse and fine components, allowing the model to capture both broad spatial structures and fine details, generating clinically accurate synthetic images. By augmenting training data with PSDM-generated samples, our model significantly improves polyp detection, classification, and segmentation. For instance, on the PolypGen dataset, PSDM increases the F1 score by 2.12% and the mean average precision by 3.09%, demonstrating superior performance in OOD scenarios and enhanced generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Medical Vision-Language Pre-training Succeed with Purely Synthetic Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13523v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP) has made significant progress in enabling zero-shot tasks for medical image understanding. However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: "Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?" To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained exclusively on synthetic data outperform those trained on real data by 3.8% in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of 9.07%. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.</p></details> | Under Review |

Morphological factors such as size, location, texture, and variable appearance complicate tumor inspection. Medical imaging presents challenges, including noise and incomplete images. This research article presents a methodology for processing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, encompassing techniques for image classification and denoising. The effective use of MRI images allows medical professionals to detect brain disorders, including tumors. This research aims to categorize healthy brain tissue and brain tumors by analyzing the provided MRI data. Unlike alternative methods like Computed Tomography (CT), MRI technology offers a more detailed representation of internal anatomical components, making it a suitable option for studying data related to brain tumors. The MRI picture is first subjected to a denoising technique utilizing an Anisotropic diffusion filter. The dataset utilized for the models creation is a publicly accessible and validated Brain Tumour Classification (MRI) database, comprising 3,264 brain MRI scans. SMOTE was employed for data augmentation and dataset balancing. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) such as ResNet152V2, VGG, ViT, and EfficientNet were employed for the classification procedure. EfficientNet attained an accuracy of 98%, the highest recorded.</p></details> |  |

However, the creation of high-quality annotated datasets for training remains a major challenge. This study introduces a novel single-stage approach (HistoSmith) for generating image-label pairs to augment histology datasets. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with separate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a latent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts, classification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data generation by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types, quantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset and the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and diverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell instance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented cell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultrasound Image Generation using Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08580v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models for image generation have been a subject of increasing interest due to their ability to generate diverse, high-quality images. Image generation has immense potential in medical imaging because open-source medical images are difficult to obtain compared to natural images, especially for rare conditions. The generated images can be used later to train classification and segmentation models. In this paper, we propose simulating realistic ultrasound (US) images by successive fine-tuning of large diffusion models on different publicly available databases. To do so, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, on BUSI (Breast US Images) an ultrasound breast image dataset. We successfully generated high-quality US images of the breast using simple prompts that specify the organ and pathology, which appeared realistic to three experienced US scientists and a US radiologist. Additionally, we provided user control by conditioning the model with segmentations through ControlNet. We will release the source code at http://code.sonography.ai/ to allow fast US image generation to the scientific community.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages conference paper for SPIE medical imaging</p></details> |
| **[Diverse Image Generation with Diffusion Models and Cross Class Label Learning for Polyp Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05444v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologic diagnosis is a critical phase in deciding the optimal treatment procedure for dealing with colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

However, as the text to nature image models, we show that the T2MedI model can also bias to some subgroups to overlook the minority ones in the training set. In this work, we first build a T2MedI model based on the pre-trained Imagen model, which has the fixed contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) text encoder, while its decoder has been fine-tuned on medical images from the Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset. Its gender bias is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Toward this issue, we propose to fine-tune the T2MedI toward the target application dataset to align their sensitive subgroups distribution probability. Specifically, the alignment loss for fine-tuning is guided by an off-the-shelf sensitivity-subgroup classifier to match the classification probability between the generated images and the expected target dataset. In addition, the image quality is maintained by a CLIP-consistency regularization term following a knowledge distillation scheme. For evaluation, we set the target dataset to be enhanced as the BraST18 dataset, and trained a brain magnetic resonance (MR) slice-based gender classifier from it. With our method, the generated MR image can markedly reduce the inconsistency with the gender proportion in the BraTS18 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

However, manual assessments are subjective and prone to variability. In response, we introduce FDDM, a novel framework bridging the gap between patch classification and region-based segmentation. FDDM operates in two stages: patch-based classification, followed by region-based refinement, enabling cross-patch information intergation. Leveraging a newly curated dataset of osteosarcoma images, FDDM demonstrates superior segmentation performance, achieving up to a 10% improvement mIOU and a 32.12% enhancement in necrosis rate estimation over state-of-the-art methods. This framework sets a new benchmark in osteosarcoma assessment, highlighting the potential of foundation models and diffusion-based refinements in complex medical imaging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

Diffusion models, a recent generative modeling technique, offer a potential solution by generating synthetic and realistic data. However, questions remain about the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on original and synthetic datasets. If diffusion-generated samples can help CNN models perform comparably to those trained on original datasets, reliance on patient-specific data for training CNNs might be reduced. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of diffusion models for generating synthetic medical images to train CNNs in three domains: Brain Tumor MRI, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), and SARS-CoV-2 CT scans. A diffusion model was trained to generate synthetic datasets for each domain. Pre-trained CNN architectures were then trained on these synthetic datasets and evaluated on unseen real data. All three datasets achieved promising classification performance using CNNs trained on synthetic data. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) analysis revealed that the models focused on relevant image features for classification. This study demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to generate synthetic medical images for training CNNs in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this study explores the use of generative models, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Progressive Growing Generative Adversarial Networks (PGGANs), for dataset augmentation. The research introduces a framework to assess the impact of synthetic images generated by DDPM and PGGANs on the performance of four models: a custom CNN, Untrained VGG16, Pretrained VGG16, and Pretrained ResNet50. Experiments were conducted using Random Sampling and Greedy K Sampling to create small, imbalanced datasets. The synthetic images were evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and compared to original datasets through classification metrics. The results show that DDPM consistently generated more realistic images with lower FID scores and significantly outperformed PGGANs in improving classification metrics across all models and datasets. Incorporating DDPM-generated images into the original datasets increased accuracy by up to 6%, enhancing model robustness and stability, particularly in imbalanced scenarios. Random Sampling demonstrated superior stability, while Greedy K Sampling offered diversity at the cost of higher FID scores. This study highlights the efficacy of DDPM in augmenting small, imbalanced medical image datasets, improving model performance by balancing the dataset and expanding its size.</p></details> |  |

While radiologists build such expertise over years of experience, it is challenging for AI models to learn where to look with limited amounts of training data. This limitation results in unsatisfying robustness in medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion-based Feature Augmentation (DAug), a portable method that improves a perception model's performance with a generative model's output. Specifically, we extend a radiology image to multiple channels, with the additional channels being the heatmaps of regions where diseases tend to develop. A diffusion-based image-to-image translation model was used to generate such heatmaps conditioned on selected disease classes. Our method is motivated by the fact that generative models learn the distribution of normal and abnormal images, and such knowledge is complementary to image understanding tasks. In addition, we propose the Image-Text-Class Hybrid Contrastive learning to utilize both text and class labels. With two novel approaches combined, our method surpasses baseline models without changing the model architecture, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both medical image retrieval and classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CytoDiffusion, a diffusion-based classifier that effectively models blood cell morphology, combining accurate classification with robust anomaly detection, resistance to distributional shifts, interpretability, data efficiency, and superhuman uncertainty quantification. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative models in anomaly detection (AUC 0.990 vs. 0.918), resistance to domain shifts (85.85% vs. 74.38% balanced accuracy), and performance in low-data regimes (95.88% vs. 94.95% balanced accuracy). Notably, our model generates synthetic blood cell images that are nearly indistinguishable from real images, as demonstrated by an authenticity test in which expert haematologists achieved only 52.3% accuracy (95% CI: [50.5%, 54.2%]) in distinguishing real from generated images. Furthermore, we enhance model explainability through the generation of directly interpretable counterfactual heatmaps. Our comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing these multiple performance dimensions, establishes a new benchmark for medical image analysis in haematology, ultimately enabling improved diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.

Experimental results validate the effectiveness of D-Cube across multiple medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and X-ray, showing superior performance compared to existing baseline models. D-Cube represents a new strategy in cancer detection, employing advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

This is especially problematic in medical settings, where biased models fail when applied to different hospitals or systems. In such cases, data-driven methods to reduce spurious correlations are preferred, as clinicians can directly validate the modified images. While Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Diffusion Models) show promise for natural images, they are impractical for medical use due to the difficulty of describing spurious medical features. To address this, we propose Masked Medical Image Inpainting (MaskMedPaint), which uses text-to-image diffusion models to augment training images by inpainting areas outside key classification regions to match the target domain. We demonstrate that MaskMedPaint enhances generalization to target domains across both natural (Waterbirds, iWildCam) and medical (ISIC 2018, Chest X-ray) datasets, given limited unlabeled target images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 12 pages</p></details> |

The medical imaging domain faces unique challenges due to scarce data labelling -- insufficient for standard training, and critical nature of the applications that require high performance, confidence, and explainability of the models. In this work, we propose to tackle those challenges with a single model that combines standard classification with a diffusion-based generative task in a single shared parametrisation. By sharing representations, our model effectively learns from both labeled and unlabeled data while at the same time providing accurate explanations through counterfactual examples. In our experiments, we show that our Mediffusion achieves results comparable to recent semi-supervised methods while providing more reliable and precise explanations.</p></details> |  |

Predominant methodologies in this domain have primarily focused on the direct prediction of glaucoma stage labels from longitudinal datasets. However, such methods may not adequately encapsulate the nuanced developmental trajectory of the disease. To enhance the diagnostic acumen of medical practitioners, we propose a novel diffusion-based model to predict prospective images by extrapolating from existing longitudinal fundus images of patients. The methodology delineated in this study distinctively leverages sequences of images as inputs. Subsequently, a time-aligned mask is employed to select a specific year for image generation. During the training phase, the time-aligned mask resolves the issue of irregular temporal intervals in longitudinal image sequence sampling. Additionally, we utilize a strategy of randomly masking a frame in the sequence to establish the ground truth. This methodology aids the network in continuously acquiring knowledge regarding the internal relationships among the sequences throughout the learning phase. Moreover, the introduction of textual labels is instrumental in categorizing images generated within the sequence. The empirical findings from the conducted experiments indicate that our proposed model not only effectively generates longitudinal data but also significantly improves the precision of downstream classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BIBM 2024</p></details> |

Although current medical TTI methods have made some progress in report-to-Chest-Xray (CXR) generation, their generation performance may be limited due to the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel disease-knowledge enhanced Diffusion-based TTI learning framework, named Diff-CXR, for medical report-to-CXR generation. First, to minimize the negative impacts of noisy data on generation, we devise a Latent Noise Filtering Strategy that gradually learns the general patterns of anomalies and removes them in the latent space. Then, an Adaptive Vision-Aware Textual Learning Strategy is designed to learn concise and important report embeddings in a domain-specific Vision-Language Model, providing textual guidance for Chest-Xray generation. Finally, by incorporating the general disease knowledge into the pretrained TTI model via a delicate control adapter, a disease-knowledge enhanced diffusion model is introduced to achieve realistic and precise report-to-CXR generation. Experimentally, our Diff-CXR outperforms previous SOTA medical TTI methods by 33.4\% / 8.0\% and 23.8\% / 56.4\% in the FID and mAUC score on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray, with the lowest computational complexity at 29.641 GFLOPs. Downstream experiments on three thorax disease classification benchmarks and one CXR-report generation benchmark demonstrate that Diff-CXR is effective in improving classical CXR analysis methods. Notably, models trained on the combination of 1\% real data and synthetic data can achieve a competitive mAUC score compared to models trained on all data, presenting promising clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Explanations for Medical Image Classification and Regression using Diffusion Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01571v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual explanations (CEs) aim to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models by illustrating how alterations in input features would affect the resulting predictions. Common CE approaches require an additional model and are typically constrained to binary counterfactuals. In contrast, we propose a novel method that operates directly on the latent space of a generative model, specifically a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE). This approach offers inherent interpretability by enabling the generation of CEs and the continuous visualization of the model's internal representation across decision boundaries. Our method leverages the DAE's ability to encode images into a semantically rich latent space in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled data or separate feature extraction models. We show that these latent representations are helpful for medical condition classification and the ordinal regression of severity pathologies, such as vertebral compression fractures (VCF) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Beyond binary CEs, our method supports the visualization of ordinal CEs using a linear model, providing deeper insights into the model's decision-making process and enhancing interpretability. Experiments across various medical imaging datasets demonstrate the method's advantages in interpretability and versatility. The linear manifold of the DAE's latent space allows for meaningful interpolation and manipulation, making it a powerful tool for exploring medical image properties. Our code is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13859266.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2024:024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.12031</p></details> |
| **[RadGazeGen: Radiomics and Gaze-guided Medical Image Generation using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00307v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present RadGazeGen, a novel framework for integrating experts' eye gaze patterns and radiomic feature maps as controls to text-to-image diffusion models for high fidelity medical image generation. Despite the recent success of text-to-image diffusion models, text descriptions are often found to be inadequate and fail to convey detailed disease-specific information to these models to generate clinically accurate images. The anatomy, disease texture patterns, and location of the disease are extremely important to generate realistic images; moreover the fidelity of image generation can have significant implications in downstream tasks involving disease diagnosis or treatment repose assessment. Hence, there is a growing need to carefully define the controls used in diffusion models for medical image generation. Eye gaze patterns of radiologists are important visuo-cognitive information, indicative of subtle disease patterns and spatial location. Radiomic features further provide important subvisual cues regarding disease phenotype. In this work, we propose to use these gaze patterns in combination with standard radiomics descriptors, as controls, to generate anatomically correct and disease-aware medical images. RadGazeGen is evaluated for image generation quality and diversity on the REFLACX dataset. To demonstrate clinical applicability, we also show classification performance on the generated images from the CheXpert test set (n=500) and long-tailed learning performance on the MIMIC-CXR-LT test set (n=23550).</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Imbalanced Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14313v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data often has a long-tailed distribution, where the scarcity of tail samples significantly limits the model's generalization ability. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are generative models based on stochastic differential equation theory and have demonstrated impressive performance in image classification tasks. However, existing diffusion probabilistic models do not perform satisfactorily in classifying tail classes. In this work, we propose the Anisotropic Diffusion Probabilistic Model (ADPM) for imbalanced image classification problems. We utilize the data distribution to control the diffusion speed of different class samples during the forward process, effectively improving the classification accuracy of the denoiser in the reverse process. Specifically, we provide a theoretical strategy for selecting noise levels for different categories in the diffusion process based on error analysis theory to address the imbalanced classification problem. Furthermore, we integrate global and local image prior in the forward process to enhance the model's discriminative ability in the spatial dimension, while incorporate semantic-level contextual information in the reverse process to boost the model's discriminative power and robustness. Through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on four medical benchmark datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling long-tail data. Our results confirm that the anisotropic diffusion model significantly improves the classification accuracy of rare classes while maintaining the accuracy of head classes. On the skin lesion datasets, PAD-UFES and HAM10000, the F1-scores of our method improved by 4% and 3%, respectively compared to the original diffusion probabilistic model.</p></details> |  |

While inference with these systems on consumer-grade GPUs is increasingly feasible, training from scratch requires large captioned datasets and significant computational resources. In medical image generation, the limited availability of large, publicly accessible datasets with text reports poses challenges due to legal and ethical concerns. This work shows that adapting pre-trained Stable Diffusion models to medical imaging modalities is achievable by training text embeddings using Textual Inversion. In this study, we experimented with small medical datasets (100 samples each from three modalities) and trained within hours to generate diagnostically accurate images, as judged by an expert radiologist. Experiments with Textual Inversion training and inference parameters reveal the necessity of larger embeddings and more examples in the medical domain. Classification experiments show an increase in diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, from 0.78 to 0.80. Further experiments demonstrate embedding flexibility through disease interpolation, combining pathologies, and inpainting for precise disease appearance control. The trained embeddings are compact (less than 1 MB), enabling easy data sharing with reduced privacy concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MIDL 2024</p></details> |

This distribution presents a significant challenge because rare conditions are critical to detect and difficult to classify due to limited data. In this paper, rather than attempting to classify rare classes, we aim to detect these as out-of-distribution data reliably. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem. We significantly improve the OOD detection performance on a challenging histopathological task with only ten samples per tail class without losing classification accuracy on the head classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving EEG Classification Through Randomly Reassembling Original and Generated Data with Transformer-based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20253v2)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has been widely used in various medical and engineering applications, where it is important for understanding brain function, diagnosing diseases, and assessing mental health conditions. However, the scarcity of EEG data severely restricts the performance of EEG classification networks, and generative model-based data augmentation methods have emerged as potential solutions to overcome this challenge. There are two problems with existing methods: (1) The quality of the generated EEG signals is not high; (2) The enhancement of EEG classification networks is not effective. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a generated data-based augmentation method to address the above two problems. For the characteristics of EEG signals, we propose a constant-factor scaling method to preprocess the signals, which reduces the loss of information. We incorporated Multi-Scale Convolution and Dynamic Fourier Spectrum Information modules into the model, improving the stability of the training process and the quality of the generated data. The proposed augmentation method randomly reassemble the generated data with original data in the time-domain to obtain vicinal data, which improves the model performance by minimizing the empirical risk and the vicinal risk. We verify the proposed augmentation method on four EEG datasets for four tasks and observe significant accuracy performance improvements: 14.00% on the Bonn dataset; 6.38% on the SleepEDF-20 dataset; 9.42% on the FACED dataset; 2.5% on the Shu dataset. We will make the code of our method publicly accessible soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Evolution of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Diffusion-based Morphing Model for X-ray Medical Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00891v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that significantly affects the mobility of older adults. In the medical domain, images containing temporal data are frequently utilized to study temporal dynamics and statistically monitor disease progression. While deep learning-based generative models for natural images have been widely researched, there are comparatively few methods available for synthesizing temporal knee X-rays. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning model designed to synthesize intermediate X-ray images between a specific patient's healthy knee and severe KOA stages. During the testing phase, based on a healthy knee X-ray, the proposed model can produce a continuous and effective sequence of KOA X-ray images with varying degrees of severity. Specifically, we introduce a Diffusion-based Morphing Model by modifying the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Our approach integrates diffusion and morphing modules, enabling the model to capture spatial morphing details between source and target knee X-ray images and synthesize intermediate frames along a geodesic path. A hybrid loss consisting of diffusion loss, morphing loss, and supervision loss was employed. We demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the highest temporal frame synthesis performance, effectively augmenting data for classification models and simulating the progression of KOA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Sample Quality via the Latent Space of Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15171v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in generative models increase the need for sample quality assessment. To do so, previous methods rely on a pre-trained feature extractor to embed the generated samples and real samples into a common space for comparison. However, different feature extractors might lead to inconsistent assessment outcomes. Moreover, these methods are not applicable for domains where a robust, universal feature extractor does not yet exist, such as medical images or 3D assets. In this paper, we propose to directly examine the latent space of the trained generative model to infer generated sample quality. This is feasible because the quality a generated sample directly relates to the amount of training data resembling it, and we can infer this information by examining the density of the latent space. Accordingly, we use a latent density score function to quantify sample quality. We show that the proposed score correlates highly with the sample quality for various generative models including VAEs, GANs and Latent Diffusion Models. Compared with previous quality assessment methods, our method has the following advantages: 1) pre-generation quality estimation with reduced computational cost, 2) generalizability to various domains and modalities, and 3) applicability to latent-based image editing and generation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods can benefit downstream tasks such as few-shot image classification and latent face image editing.

| **[GenMix: Combining Generative and Mixture Data Augmentation for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20650v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique called GenMix, which combines generative and mixture approaches to leverage the strengths of both methods. While generative models excel at creating new data patterns, they face challenges such as mode collapse in GANs and difficulties in training diffusion models, especially with limited medical imaging data. On the other hand, mixture models enhance class boundary regions but tend to favor the major class in scenarios with class imbalance. To address these limitations, GenMix integrates both approaches to complement each other. GenMix operates in two stages: (1) training a generative model to produce synthetic images, and (2) performing mixup between synthetic and real data. This process improves the quality and diversity of synthetic data while simultaneously benefiting from the new pattern learning of generative models and the boundary enhancement of mixture models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) in CT images. Our results demonstrate that GenMix enhances the performance of various generative models, including DCGAN, StyleGAN, Textual Inversion, and Diffusion Models. Notably, the proposed method with Textual Inversion outperforms other methods without fine-tuning diffusion model on the FLL dataset.</p></details> |  |

Scaling Medical Diffusion via Self-Supervised Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11594v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful foundation models for a variety of tasks, with a large focus in synthetic image generation. However, their requirement of large annotated datasets for training limits their applicability in medical imaging, where datasets are typically smaller and sparsely annotated. We introduce DiNO-Diffusion, a self-supervised method for training latent diffusion models (LDMs) that conditions the generation process on image embeddings extracted from DiNO. By eliminating the reliance on annotations, our training leverages over 868k unlabelled images from public chest X-Ray (CXR) datasets. Despite being self-supervised, DiNO-Diffusion shows comprehensive manifold coverage, with FID scores as low as 4.7, and emerging properties when evaluated in downstream tasks. It can be used to generate semantically-diverse synthetic datasets even from small data pools, demonstrating up to 20% AUC increase in classification performance when used for data augmentation. Images were generated with different sampling strategies over the DiNO embedding manifold and using real images as a starting point. Results suggest, DiNO-Diffusion could facilitate the creation of large datasets for flexible training of downstream AI models from limited amount of real data, while also holding potential for privacy preservation. Additionally, DiNO-Diffusion demonstrates zero-shot segmentation performance of up to 84.4% Dice score when evaluating lung lobe segmentation. This evidences good CXR image-anatomy alignment, akin to segmenting using textual descriptors on vanilla DMs. Finally, DiNO-Diffusion can be easily adapted to other medical imaging modalities or state-of-the-art diffusion models, opening the door for large-scale, multi-domain image generation pipelines for medical imaging.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Without directly comparable methods in 3D medical imaging, we benchmarked GenerateCT against cutting-edge methods, demonstrating its superiority across all key metrics. Importantly, we evaluated GenerateCT's clinical applications in a multi-abnormality classification task. First, we established a baseline by training a multi-abnormality classifier on our real dataset. To further assess the model's generalization to external data and performance with unseen prompts in a zero-shot scenario, we employed an external set to train the classifier, setting an additional benchmark. We conducted two experiments in which we doubled the training datasets by synthesizing an equal number of volumes for each set using GenerateCT. The first experiment demonstrated an 11% improvement in the AP score when training the classifier jointly on real and generated volumes. The second experiment showed a 7% improvement when training on both real and generated volumes based on unseen prompts. Moreover, GenerateCT enables the scaling of synthetic training datasets to arbitrary sizes. As an example, we generated 100,000 3D CTs, fivefold the number in our real set, and trained the classifier exclusively on these synthetic CTs. Impressively, this classifier surpassed the performance of the one trained on all available real data by a margin of 8%. Last, domain experts evaluated the generated volumes, confirming a high degree of alignment with the text prompt.

| **[Image Distillation for Safe Data Sharing in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13536v3)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology can help clinicians make accurate diagnoses, determine disease prognosis, and plan appropriate treatment strategies. As deep learning techniques prove successful in the medical domain, the primary challenges become limited data availability and concerns about data sharing and privacy. Federated learning has addressed this challenge by training models locally and updating parameters on a server. However, issues, such as domain shift and bias, persist and impact overall performance. Dataset distillation presents an alternative approach to overcoming these challenges. It involves creating a small synthetic dataset that encapsulates essential information, which can be shared without constraints. At present, this paradigm is not practicable as current distillation approaches only generate non human readable representations and exhibit insufficient performance for downstream learning tasks. We train a latent diffusion model and construct a new distilled synthetic dataset with a small number of human readable synthetic images. Selection of maximally informative synthetic images is done via graph community analysis of the representation space. We compare downstream classification models trained on our synthetic distillation data to models trained on real data and reach performances suitable for practical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Recently, the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) has shown the potential to generate high-quality images by converting Gaussian random noise into realistic images. In this paper, we apply the DPM to augment the deep ultraviolet fluorescence (DUV) image dataset with an aim to improve breast cancer classification for intraoperative margin assessment. For classification, we divide the whole surface DUV image into small patches and extract convolutional features for each patch by utilizing the pre-trained ResNet. Then, we feed them into an XGBoost classifier for patch-level decisions and then fuse them with a regional importance map computed by Grad-CAM++ for whole surface-level prediction. Our experimental results show that augmenting the training dataset with the DPM significantly improves breast cancer detection performance in DUV images, increasing accuracy from 93% to 97%, compared to using Affine transformations and ProGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2024</p></details> |

While Vision Transformer has shown superior performance over convolutional neural networks in image classification tasks, their effectiveness is often demonstrated on sufficiently large 2D datasets and they easily encounter overfitting issues on small medical image datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a Diffusion-based 3D Vision Transformer (Diff3Dformer), which utilizes the latent space of the Diffusion model to form the slice sequence for 3D analysis and incorporates clustering attention into ViT to aggregate repetitive information within 3D CT scans, thereby harnessing the power of the advanced transformer in 3D classification tasks on small datasets. Our method exhibits improved performance on two different scales of small datasets of 3D lung CT scans, surpassing the state of the art 3D methods and other transformer-based approaches that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its robust and superior performance across different scales of data. Experimental results underscore the superiority of our proposed method, indicating its potential for enhancing medical image classification tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | conference |

Methods: This paper proposes the Guided Conditional Diffusion Classifier (ConDiff), a novel deep-learning infection detection model that combines guided image synthesis with a denoising diffusion model and distance-based classification. The process involves (1) generating guided conditional synthetic images by injecting Gaussian noise to a guide image, followed by denoising the noise-perturbed image through a reverse diffusion process, conditioned on infection status and (2) classifying infections based on the minimum Euclidean distance between synthesized images and the original guide image in embedding space. Results: ConDiff demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 83% and an F1-score of 0.858, outperforming state-of-the-art models by at least 3%. The use of a triplet loss function reduces overfitting in the distance-based classifier. Conclusions: ConDiff not only enhances diagnostic accuracy for DFU infections but also pioneers the use of generative discriminative models for detailed medical image analysis, offering a promising approach for improving patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, medical datasets often face challenges related to limited sample sizes and inherent imbalanced distributions, due to difficulties in data collection and variations in disease prevalence across different types. In this paper, we introduce an Iterative Online Image Synthesis (IOIS) framework to address the class imbalance problem in medical image classification. Our framework incorporates two key modules, namely Online Image Synthesis (OIS) and Accuracy Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which collectively target the imbalance classification issue at both the instance level and the class level. The OIS module alleviates the data insufficiency problem by generating representative samples tailored for online training of the classifier. On the other hand, the AAS module dynamically balances the synthesized samples among various classes, targeting those with low training accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method in addressing imbalanced classification, we conduct experiments on the HAM10000 and APTOS datasets. The results obtained demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods as well as the effectiveness of each component. The source code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (weather, location, etc.). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata, and its heterogeneity poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce Time Weaver, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that Time Weaver outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 27% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion of Diffusion Weighted MRI and Clinical Data for Predicting Functional Outcome after Acute Ischemic Stroke with Deep Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10894v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stroke is a common disabling neurological condition that affects about one-quarter of the adult population over age 25; more than half of patients still have poor outcomes, such as permanent functional dependence or even death, after the onset of acute stroke. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted MRI modalities combining with structured health profile on predicting the functional outcome to facilitate early intervention. A deep fusion learning network is proposed with two-stage training: the first stage focuses on cross-modality representation learning and the second stage on classification. Supervised contrastive learning is exploited to learn discriminative features that separate the two classes of patients from embeddings of individual modalities and from the fused multimodal embedding. The network takes as the input DWI and ADC images, and structured health profile data. The outcome is the prediction of the patient needing long-term care at 3 months after the onset of stroke. Trained and evaluated with a dataset of 3297 patients, our proposed fusion model achieves 0.87, 0.80 and 80.45% for AUC, F1-score and accuracy, respectively, outperforming existing models that consolidate both imaging and structured data in the medical domain. If trained with comprehensive clinical variables, including NIHSS and comorbidities, the gain from images on making accurate prediction is not considered substantial, but significant. However, diffusion-weighted MRI can replace NIHSS to achieve comparable level of accuracy combining with other readily available clinical variables for better generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a noncontact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used. The final classification maps obtained have been analyzed and validated by specialists. These preliminary results are promising, obtaining an accurate delineation of the tumor area.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing computer-aided skin cancer classification systems employ deep learning approaches. However, recent studies reveal their extreme vulnerability to adversarial attacks -- often imperceptible perturbations to significantly reduce the performances of skin cancer diagnosis models. To mitigate these threats, this work presents a simple, effective, and resource-efficient defense framework by reverse engineering adversarial perturbations in skin cancer images. Specifically, a multiscale image pyramid is first established to better preserve discriminative structures in the medical imaging domain. To neutralize adversarial effects, skin images at different scales are then progressively diffused by injecting isotropic Gaussian noises to move the adversarial examples to the clean image manifold. Crucially, to further reverse adversarial noises and suppress redundant injected noises, a novel multiscale denoising mechanism is carefully designed that aggregates image information from neighboring scales. We evaluated the defensive effectiveness of our method on ISIC 2019, a largest skin cancer multiclass classification dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully reverse adversarial perturbations from different attacks and significantly outperform some state-of-the-art methods in defending skin cancer diagnosis models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

However, traditional data gathering methods are too slow for these scenarios necessitating innovative approaches to generate reliable models quickly from minimal data. We demonstrate our new approach by building a comprehensive computer vision model for detecting Human Papilloma Virus Genital warts using only synthetic data. In our study, we employed a two phase experimental design using diffusion models. In the first phase diffusion models were utilized to generate a large number of diverse synthetic images from 10 HPV guide images explicitly focusing on accurately depicting genital warts. The second phase involved the training and testing vision model using this synthetic dataset. This method aimed to assess the effectiveness of diffusion models in rapidly generating high quality training data and the subsequent impact on the vision model performance in medical image recognition. The study findings revealed significant insights into the performance of the vision model trained on synthetic images generated through diffusion models. The vision model showed exceptional performance in accurately identifying cases of genital warts. It achieved an accuracy rate of 96% underscoring its effectiveness in medical image classification. For HPV cases the model demonstrated a high precision of 99% and a recall of 94%. In normal cases the precision was 95% with an impressive recall of 99%. These metrics indicate the model capability to correctly identify true positive cases and minimize false positives. The model achieved an F1 Score of 96% for HPV cases and 97% for normal cases. The high F1 Score across both categories highlights the balanced nature of the model precision and recall ensuring reliability and robustness in its predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages 5 figures 1 table</p></details> |

Open-source medical datasets, while valuable, suffer from data quality and clinical information disparities. Generative models, such as diffusion models, aim to mitigate these challenges. At Stanford, researchers explored the utility of a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model (RoentGen) for medical imaging data augmentation. Our work examines specific considerations to expand the Stanford research question, Could Stable Diffusion Solve a Gap in Medical Imaging Data? from the lens of bias and validity of the generated outcomes. We leveraged RoentGen to produce synthetic Chest-XRay (CXR) images and conducted assessments on bias, validity, and hallucinations. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by a disease classifier, while a COVID classifier uncovered latent hallucinations. The bias analysis unveiled disparities in classification performance among various subgroups, with a pronounced impact on the Female Hispanic subgroup. Furthermore, incorporating race and gender into input prompts exacerbated fairness issues in the generated images. The quality of synthetic images exhibited variability, particularly in certain disease classes, where there was more significant uncertainty compared to the original images. Additionally, we observed latent hallucinations, with approximately 42% of the images incorrectly indicating COVID, hinting at the presence of hallucinatory elements. These identifications provide new research directions towards interpretability of synthetic CXR images, for further understanding of associated risks and patient safety in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) - "Medical Imaging Meets NeurIPS" Workshop</p></details> |

However, the need for annotated medical images is often an obstacle to leveraging the full power of machine learning models. Our research demonstrates that by combining synthetic images, generated using diffusion models, with real images, we can enhance nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) classification performance even in low-data regime settings. We evaluate the quality of the synthetic images by comparing two metrics: Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID), computed on diffusion- and generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated images. Our results show superior performance for the diffusion-generated images, with a maximum IS score of $1.90$ compared to $1.67$ for GANs, and a minimum FID score of $69.45$ compared to $100.05$ for GANs. Utilizing a partially frozen CNN backbone (EfficientNet v1), our synthetic augmentation method achieves a maximum image-level ROC AUC of $0.904$ on a NAFLD prediction task.</p></details> | 36 pages, 13 figures |

However, their use for sequential data like respiratory sounds is less explored. In this work, we propose a straightforward approach to augment imbalanced respiratory sound data using an audio diffusion model as a conditional neural vocoder. We also demonstrate a simple yet effective adversarial fine-tuning method to align features between the synthetic and real respiratory sound samples to improve respiratory sound classification performance. Our experimental results on the ICBHI dataset demonstrate that the proposed adversarial fine-tuning is effective, while only using the conventional augmentation method shows performance degradation. Moreover, our method outperforms the baseline by 2.24% on the ICBHI Score and improves the accuracy of the minority classes up to 26.58%.

However, real DFU datasets are limited, hindering clinical training and research activities. In recent years, generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating synthetic images with remarkable realism and diversity in many applications. This paper explores the potential of diffusion models for synthesizing DFU images and evaluates their authenticity through expert clinician assessments. Additionally, evaluation metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) are examined to assess the quality of the synthetic DFU images. A dataset of 2,000 DFU images is used for training the diffusion model, and the synthetic images are generated by applying diffusion processes. The results indicate that the diffusion model successfully synthesizes visually indistinguishable DFU images. 70% of the time, clinicians marked synthetic DFU images as real DFUs. However, clinicians demonstrate higher unanimous confidence in rating real images than synthetic ones. The study also reveals that FID and KID metrics do not significantly align with clinicians' assessments, suggesting alternative evaluation approaches are needed. The findings highlight the potential of diffusion models for generating synthetic DFU images and their impact on medical training programs and research in wound detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 6th Workshop on AI for Aging, Rehabilitation and Intelligent Assisted Living at European Conference on Machine Learning, Italy, 2023</p></details> |

However, existing models struggle with complex relationships and characteristics of spectral-spatial data due to the multi-band nature and data redundancy of hyperspectral data. To address this limitation, we propose a new network called DiffSpectralNet, which combines diffusion and transformer techniques. Our approach involves a two-step process. First, we use an unsupervised learning framework based on the diffusion model to extract both high-level and low-level spectral-spatial features. The diffusion method is capable of extracting diverse and meaningful spectral-spatial features, leading to improvement in HSI classification. Then, we employ a pretrained denoising U-Net to extract intermediate hierarchical features for classification. Finally, we use a supervised transformer-based classifier to perform the HSI classification. Through comprehensive experiments on HSI datasets, we evaluate the classification performance of DiffSpectralNet. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We may therefore increase the interpretability of deep learning models by imbuing them with a similar style of reasoning. In this work, we apply this principle by classifying Alzheimer's Disease based on the similarity of images to training examples within the latent space. We use a contrastive loss combined with a diffusion autoencoder backbone, to produce a semantically meaningful latent space, such that neighbouring latents have similar image-level features. We achieve a classification accuracy comparable to black box approaches on a dataset of 2D MRI images, whilst producing human interpretable model explanations. Therefore, this work stands as a contribution to the pertinent development of accurate and interpretable deep learning within medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certification of Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03664v1)** | 2023-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, segmentation models have known a significant improvement in the past decade and are now used daily in clinical practice. However, similar to classification models, segmentation models are affected by adversarial attacks. In a safety-critical field like healthcare, certifying model predictions is of the utmost importance. Randomized smoothing has been introduced lately and provides a framework to certify models and obtain theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we present for the first time a certified segmentation baseline for medical imaging based on randomized smoothing and diffusion models. Our results show that leveraging the power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models helps us overcome the limits of randomized smoothing. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets of chest X-rays, skin lesions, and colonoscopies, and empirically show that we are able to maintain high certified Dice scores even for highly perturbed images. Our work represents the first attempt to certify medical image segmentation models, and we aspire for it to set a foundation for future benchmarks in this crucial and largely uncharted area.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIE: Simulating Disease Progression via Progressive Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11745v2)** | 2023-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disease progression simulation is a crucial area of research that has significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from 35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2% of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to model disease trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and checkpoints for replicating our results can be found at https://github.com/IrohXu/PIE and https://huggingface.co/IrohXu/stable-diffusion-mimic-cxr-v0.1</p></details> |

Current techniques for evaluating deep learning models cannot visualize confounding factors at a diagnostic level. Here, we propose a self-conditioned diffusion model termed DiffChest and train it on a dataset of 515,704 chest radiographs from 194,956 patients from multiple healthcare centers in the United States and Europe. DiffChest explains classifications on a patient-specific level and visualizes the confounding factors that may mislead the model. We found high inter-reader agreement when evaluating DiffChest's capability to identify treatment-related confounders, with Fleiss' Kappa values of 0.8 or higher across most imaging findings. Confounders were accurately captured with 11.1% to 100% prevalence rates. Furthermore, our pretraining process optimized the model to capture the most relevant information from the input radiographs. DiffChest achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy when diagnosing 11 chest conditions, such as pleural effusion and cardiac insufficiency, and at least sufficient diagnostic accuracy for the remaining conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of pretraining based on diffusion models in medical image classification, specifically in providing insights into confounding factors and model robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Structural and Functional Connectivities using Disentangled VAE for Detecting MCI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09629v2)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain network analysis is a useful approach to studying human brain disorders because it can distinguish patients from healthy people by detecting abnormal connections. Due to the complementary information from multiple modal neuroimages, multimodal fusion technology has a lot of potential for improving prediction performance. However, effective fusion of multimodal medical images to achieve complementarity is still a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel hierarchical structural-functional connectivity fusing (HSCF) model is proposed to construct brain structural-functional connectivity matrices and predict abnormal brain connections based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Specifically, the prior knowledge is incorporated into the separators for disentangling each modality of information by the graph convolutional networks (GCN). And a disentangled cosine distance loss is devised to ensure the disentanglement's effectiveness. Moreover, the hierarchical representation fusion module is designed to effectively maximize the combination of relevant and effective features between modalities, which makes the generated structural-functional connectivity more robust and discriminative in the cognitive disease analysis. Results from a wide range of tests performed on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database show that the proposed model performs better than competing approaches in terms of classification evaluation. In general, the proposed HSCF model is a promising model for generating brain structural-functional connectivities and identifying abnormal brain connections as cognitive disease progresses.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Synthetic Augmentation with Large-scale Unconditional Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04020v1)** | 2023-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based medical image recognition systems often require a substantial amount of training data with expert annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Recently, synthetic augmentation techniques have been proposed to mitigate the issue by generating realistic images conditioned on class labels. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the representation capability of the trained generative model, which cannot be guaranteed without sufficient labeled training data. To further reduce the dependency on annotated data, we propose a synthetic augmentation method called HistoDiffusion, which can be pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and later applied to a small-scale labeled dataset for augmented training. In particular, we train a latent diffusion model (LDM) on diverse unlabeled datasets to learn common features and generate realistic images without conditional inputs. Then, we fine-tune the model with classifier guidance in latent space on an unseen labeled dataset so that the model can synthesize images of specific categories. Additionally, we adopt a selective mechanism to only add synthetic samples with high confidence of matching to target labels. We evaluate our proposed method by pre-training on three histopathology datasets and testing on a histopathology dataset of colorectal cancer (CRC) excluded from the pre-training datasets. With HistoDiffusion augmentation, the classification accuracy of a backbone classifier is remarkably improved by 6.4% using a small set of the original labels. Our code is available at https://github.com/karenyyy/HistoDiffAug.</p></details> | MICCAI 2023 |
| **[Deep Learning Approaches for Data Augmentation in Medical Imaging: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13125v1)** | 2023-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has become a popular tool for medical image analysis, but the limited availability of training data remains a major challenge, particularly in the medical field where data acquisition can be costly and subject to privacy regulations. Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

Increasing diagnosis accessibility requires fair and accurate segmentation and classification of dermatology images. However, the scarcity of annotated medical images, especially for rare diseases and underrepresented skin tones, poses a challenge to the development of fair and accurate models. In this study, we introduce a Fair, Efficient, and Diverse Diffusion-based framework for skin lesion segmentation and malignancy classification. FEDD leverages semantically meaningful feature embeddings learned through a denoising diffusion probabilistic backbone and processes them via linear probes to achieve state-of-the-art performance on Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). We achieve an improvement in intersection over union of 0.18, 0.13, 0.06, and 0.07 while using only 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% labeled samples, respectively. Additionally, FEDD trained on 10% of DDI demonstrates malignancy classification accuracy of 81%, 14% higher compared to the state-of-the-art. We showcase high efficiency in data-constrained scenarios while providing fair performance for diverse skin tones and rare malignancy conditions. Our newly annotated DDI segmentation masks and training code can be found on https://github.com/hectorcarrion/fedd.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMIC: Dual-Guidance Diffusion Network for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10610v3)** | 2023-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models have recently shown remarkable performance in generative image modeling, attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. However, while a substantial amount of diffusion-based research has focused on generative tasks, few studies have applied diffusion models to general medical image classification. In this paper, we propose the first diffusion-based model (named DiffMIC) to address general medical image classification by eliminating unexpected noise and perturbations in medical images and robustly capturing semantic representation. To achieve this goal, we devise a dual conditional guidance strategy that conditions each diffusion step with multiple granularities to improve step-wise regional attention. Furthermore, we propose learning the mutual information in each granularity by enforcing Maximum-Mean Discrepancy regularization during the diffusion forward process. We evaluate the effectiveness of our DiffMIC on three medical classification tasks with different image modalities, including placental maturity grading on ultrasound images, skin lesion classification using dermatoscopic images, and diabetic retinopathy grading using fundus images. Our experimental results demonstrate that DiffMIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, indicating the universality and effectiveness of the proposed model. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/scott-yjyang/DiffMIC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Nuclei Representations with Masked Image Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17116v1)** | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked image modelling (MIM) is a powerful self-supervised representation learning paradigm, whose potential has not been widely demonstrated in medical image analysis. In this work, we show the capacity of MIM to capture rich semantic representations of Haemotoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained images at the nuclear level. Inspired by Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers (BEiT), we split the images into smaller patches and generate corresponding discrete visual tokens. In addition to the regular grid-based patches, typically used in visual Transformers, we introduce patches of individual cell nuclei. We propose positional encoding of the irregular distribution of these structures within an image. We pre-train the model in a self-supervised manner on H&E-stained whole-slide images of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where cell nuclei have been segmented. The pre-training objective is to recover the original discrete visual tokens of the masked image on the one hand, and to reconstruct the visual tokens of the masked object instances on the other. Coupling these two pre-training tasks allows us to build powerful, context-aware representations of nuclei. Our model generalizes well and can be fine-tuned on downstream classification tasks, achieving improved cell classification accuracy on PanNuke dataset by more than 5% compared to current instance segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

Due to ethical concerns, obtaining sufficient medical data for machine learning is a challenge, which our approach aims to address by synthesising more data. We utilised the Chest X-ray 14 dataset for our experiments and evaluated the performance of our models through qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our results show that the generated images are visually convincing and can be used to improve the accuracy of classification models. However, further work is needed to address issues such as overfitting and the limited availability of real data for training and testing. The potential of our approach to contribute to more effective medical diagnosis through deep learning is promising, and we believe that continued advancements in image generation technology will lead to even more promising results in the future.</p></details> |  |

It can be classified into several subtypes, including clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed and trained for classifying different subtypes of RCC using ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a dataset of RCC histopathology images, which consisted of digital images of RCC surgical resection slides that were annotated with the corresponding subtype labels. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, in this research, a novel synthetic image generation tool, NephroNet, is developed on diffusion models that are used to generate original images of RCC surgical resection slides. Diffusion models are a class of generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from noise. Several diffusers such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth Text-to-Image, and Textual Inversion were trained on a dataset of RCC images and were used to generate a series of original images that resembled RCC surgical resection slides, all within the span of fewer than four seconds. The generated images were visually realistic and could be used for creating new training datasets, testing the performance of image analysis algorithms, and training medical professionals. NephroNet is provided as an open-source software package and contains files for data preprocessing, training, and visualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence and diffusion models for classifying and generating RCC images, respectively. These methods could be useful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of RCC and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, labeled training data for real-world applications such as healthcare is limited and difficult to access given longstanding privacy, and strict data sharing policies. By manipulating image datasets in the pixel or feature space, existing data augmentation techniques represent one of the effective ways to improve the quantity and diversity of training data. Here, we look to advance augmentation techniques by building upon the emerging success of text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models in augmenting the training samples of our macroscopic skin disease dataset. We do so by enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process via input text prompts. We demonstrate that this generative data augmentation approach successfully maintains a similar classification accuracy of the visual classifier even when trained on a fully synthetic skin disease dataset. Similar to recent applications of generative models, our study suggests that diffusion models are indeed effective in generating high-quality skin images that do not sacrifice the classifier performance, and can improve the augmentation of training datasets after curation.</p></details> |  |

However, biometric identifiers in chest radiographs hinder the public sharing of such data for research purposes due to the risk of patient re-identification. To counteract this issue, synthetic data generation offers a solution for anonymizing medical images. This work employs a latent diffusion model to synthesize an anonymous chest X-ray dataset of high-quality class-conditional images. We propose a privacy-enhancing sampling strategy to ensure the non-transference of biometric information during the image generation process. The quality of the generated images and the feasibility of serving as exclusive training data are evaluated on a thoracic abnormality classification task. Compared to a real classifier, we achieve competitive results with a performance gap of only 3.5% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Automatic Identification of Claim Spans on Twitter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04710v2)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread diffusion of medical and political claims in the wake of COVID-19 has led to a voluminous rise in misinformation and fake news. The current vogue is to employ manual fact-checkers to efficiently classify and verify such data to combat this avalanche of claim-ridden misinformation. However, the rate of information dissemination is such that it vastly outpaces the fact-checkers' strength. Therefore, to aid manual fact-checkers in eliminating the superfluous content, it becomes imperative to automatically identify and extract the snippets of claim-worthy (mis)information present in a post. In this work, we introduce the novel task of Claim Span Identification (CSI). We propose CURT, a large-scale Twitter corpus with token-level claim spans on more than 7.5k tweets. Furthermore, along with the standard token classification baselines, we benchmark our dataset with DABERTa, an adapter-based variation of RoBERTa. The experimental results attest that DABERTa outperforms the baseline systems across several evaluation metrics, improving by about 1.5 points. We also report detailed error analysis to validate the model's performance along with the ablation studies. Lastly, we release our comprehensive span annotation guidelines for public use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP22. 16 pages including Appendix</p></details> |

Neuropathic Pain (NP) is a common sub-type which is often caused due to nerve damage and has a known pathophysiology. Another common sub-type is Fibromyalgia (FM) which is described as musculoskeletal, diffuse pain that is widespread through the body. The pathophysiology of FM is poorly understood, making it very hard to diagnose. Standard medications and treatments for FM and NP differ from one another and if misdiagnosed it can cause an increase in symptom severity. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel framework, PainPoints, which accurately detects the sub-type of pain and generates clinical notes via summarizing the patient interviews. Specifically, PainPoints makes use of large language models to perform sentence-level classification of the text obtained from interviews of FM and NP patients with a reliable AUC of 0.83. Using a sufficiency-based interpretability approach, we explain how the fine-tuned model accurately picks up on the nuances that patients use to describe their pain. Finally, we generate summaries of these interviews via expert interventions by introducing a novel facet-based approach. PainPoints thus enables practitioners to add/drop facets and generate a custom summary based on the notion of "facet-coverage" which is also introduced in this work.</p></details> |  |

However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research, reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains, including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Optimal Prompt Ensemble for Multi-source Visual Prompt Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12311v5)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly for resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge. However, naive aggregation often overlooks different source prompts have different contribution potential to the target task. To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns optimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an information-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient conflicts via a novel regularization strategy. Specifically, we propose a differentiable prompt transferability metric to captures the discriminability of prompt-induced features on the target task. Meanwhile, HGPrompt match the gradient variances with respect to different source prompts based on Hessian and Fisher Information, ensuring stable and coherent knowledge transfer while suppressing gradient conflicts among them.

Although recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>homep...</summary><p>homepage: https://rex-omni.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.</p></details> |  |

We constructed a database of approximately 3,000 anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a `Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task, a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025 MLLMCP Workshop</p></details> |

Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods.

Our approach couples masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii) visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniVideo: Unified Understanding, Generation, and Editing for Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08377v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website https://congwei1230.github.io/UniVideo/</p></details> |

They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA, the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and annotations will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Visual Prompting through Expanded Transformation Space and Overfitting Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07823v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP (Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[StyleKeeper: Prevent Content Leakage using Negative Visual Query Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06827v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts. Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts.

| **[VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25033v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies ("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning, to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page: https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R Code: https://github.com/fanegg/Human3R</p></details> |

These approaches learn additional embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based IL in IOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV Workshops 2025: v2 update affiliation</p></details> |
| **[PRO-VPT: Distribution-Adaptive Visual Prompt Tuning via Prompt Relocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06901v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prompt tuning (VPT), i.e., fine-tuning some lightweight prompt tokens, provides an efficient and effective approach for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. However, most prior art indiscriminately uses a fixed prompt distribution across different tasks, neglecting the importance of each block varying depending on the task. In this paper, we introduce adaptive distribution optimization (ADO) by tackling two key questions: (1) How to appropriately and formally define ADO, and (2) How to design an adaptive distribution strategy guided by this definition? Through empirical analysis, we first confirm that properly adjusting the distribution significantly improves VPT performance, and further uncover a key insight that a nested relationship exists between ADO and VPT. Based on these findings, we propose a new VPT framework, termed PRO-VPT (iterative Prompt RelOcation-based VPT), which adaptively adjusts the distribution built upon a nested optimization formulation. Specifically, we develop a prompt relocation strategy derived from this formulation, comprising two steps: pruning idle prompts from prompt-saturated blocks, followed by allocating these prompts to the most prompt-needed blocks. By iteratively performing prompt relocation and VPT, our proposal can adaptively learn the optimal prompt distribution in a nested optimization-based manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of VPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms advanced VPT methods, e.g., PRO-VPT surpasses VPT by 1.6 pp and 2.0 pp average accuracy, leading prompt-based methods to state-of-the-art performance on VTAB-1k and FGVC benchmarks.

| **[VirDA: Reusing Backbone for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Visual Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01660v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters. Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases, we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA. Instead of fine-tuning the full backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias to the input image, adapting its "style" to a target domain. To optimize these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused across different domains. We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8% of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods (PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only 2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoMiSeg: Automatic Medical Image Segmentation via Test-Time Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17931v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline not only substantially surpasses the previously best-performing method, yielding a 69\% relative improvement in accuracy (Dice Score from 42.53 to 71.81), but also performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.</p></details> |  |

More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models with Mild Semantic Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04677v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning has shown promising results, but its robustness and generalization to unseen categories remain limited. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the complete removal of semantic noise is a key factor restricting robustness. Existing methods typically suppress or filter out semantic noise in the prompt space, inadvertently hindering the model's robustness and its ability to generalize to unseen categories. To address this, we propose ANPrompt, a robust prompt tuning framework that actively incorporates weak semantic noise. By clustering weakly perturbed features into noise prompts and integrating them with learnable tokens in both the text and vision encoders, ANPrompt ensures controlled exposure to semantic variations. To enhance the visual pathway, we introduce the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP), which stabilizes visual semantics under weak perturbations. Additionally, we propose a Weak Alignment Loss (WALoss) at the logits level to enforce consistency between clean and perturbed predictions, providing stable supervision. By combining weak semantic noise exposure with logits-based consistency, ANPrompt prevents overfitting to specific phrasings while preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmarks, including base-to-new splits, show that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning methods, offering superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization across tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding, state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from 2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change? We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over 2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models. Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code and model will be released at the link below.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIRTUE: Visual-Interactive Text-Image Universal Embedder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00523v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn entity-level information within images to complement their global representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

This has led to great interest in improving the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long) dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.</p></details> |  |

To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising. Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty.

| **[EndoBench: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Endoscopy Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23601v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing and treating internal diseases, and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied to assist in endoscopy analysis. However, current benchmarks are limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks, and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition, lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios. We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity. EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 22 figures; Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Dataset and Benchmark Track</p></details> |
| **[Robust RGB-T Tracking via Learnable Visual Fourier Prompt Fine-tuning and Modality Fusion Prompt Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19733v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features. Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally, unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our method demonstrates outstanding performance.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM2025 |
| **[HyPSAM: Hybrid Prompt-driven Segment Anything Model for RGB-Thermal Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18738v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains, thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The code and results of our method are available at: https://github.com/milotic233/HyPSAM.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready.

While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation.

However, their direct transfer to remote sensing (RS) is hindered by heterogeneous sensing physics, diverse modalities, and unique spatial scales. Existing RS MLLMs are mainly limited to optical imagery and plain language interaction, preventing flexible and scalable real-world applications. In this article, EarthGPT-X is proposed, the first flexible spatial MLLM that unifies multi-source RS imagery comprehension and accomplishes both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual tasks under diverse visual prompts in a single framework. Distinct from prior models, EarthGPT-X introduces: 1) a dual-prompt mechanism combining text instructions with various visual prompts (i.e., point, box, and free-form) to mimic the versatility of referring in human life; 2) a comprehensive multi-source multi-level prompting dataset, the model advances beyond holistic image understanding to support hierarchical spatial reasoning, including scene-level understanding and fine-grained object attributes and relational analysis; 3) a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy, enabling efficient and consistent alignment across modalities and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthGPT-X substantially outperforms prior nature and RS MLLMs, establishing the first framework capable of multi-source, multi-task, and multi-level interpretation using visual prompting in RS scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[FC-Attack: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Auto-Generated Flowcharts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21059v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most MLLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, MLLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute the jailbreak attack on MLLMs. Our evaluations on Advbench show that FC-Attack attains an attack success rate of up to 96% via images and up to 78% via videos across multiple MLLMs. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. We also find that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Manipulation Facing Threats: Evaluating Physical Vulnerabilities in End-to-End Vision Language Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13174v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepCaM++: Exploring Transparent Visual Prompt With Inference-Time Re-Parameterization for Neural Video Delivery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14002v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, content-aware methods have been employed to reduce bandwidth and enhance the quality of Internet video delivery. These methods involve training distinct content-aware super-resolution (SR) models for each video chunk on the server, subsequently streaming the low-resolution (LR) video chunks with the SR models to the client. Prior research has incorporated additional partial parameters to customize the models for individual video chunks. However, this leads to parameter accumulation and can fail to adapt appropriately as video lengths increase, resulting in increased delivery costs and reduced performance. In this paper, we introduce RepCaM++, an innovative framework based on a novel Re-parameterization Content-aware Modulation (RepCaM) module that uniformly modulates video chunks. The RepCaM framework integrates extra parallel-cascade parameters during training to accommodate multiple chunks, subsequently eliminating these additional parameters through re-parameterization during inference. Furthermore, to enhance RepCaM's performance, we propose the Transparent Visual Prompt (TVP), which includes a minimal set of zero-initialized image-level parameters (e.g., less than 0.1%) to capture fine details within video chunks. We conduct extensive experiments on the VSD4K dataset, encompassing six different video scenes, and achieve state-of-the-art results in video restoration quality and delivery bandwidth compression.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) for the accurate detection and classification of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods: We propose an end-to-end CAD pipeline consisting of two modules: (i) a detection module (CADe) based on the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in which the standard visual prompt is replaced with a text prompt encoded by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and (ii) a diagnosis module (CADx) that calculates similarity scores between segmented nodules and radiomic features. To add clinical context, synthetic electronic medical records (EMRs) were generated using radiomic assessments by expert radiologists and combined with similarity scores for final classification. The method was tested on the publicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset (1,018 CT scans). Results: The proposed approach demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot lung nodule analysis. The CADe module achieved a Dice score of 0.92 and an IoU of 0.85 for nodule segmentation. The CADx module attained a specificity of 0.97 for malignancy classification, surpassing existing fully supervised methods. Conclusions: The integration of VLMs with radiomics and synthetic EMRs allows for accurate and clinically relevant CAD of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. The proposed system shows strong potential to enhance early lung cancer detection, increase diagnostic confidence, and improve patient management in routine clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLaVE-Cap: Global-Local Aligned Video Captioning with Vision Expert Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11360v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning, which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning, and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption. Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realism Control One-step Diffusion for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10122v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions. While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency. Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference stage. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |

Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference, these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image." Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level vision tasks.

Our final submission achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8837 and an ROC-AUC of 0.9513 on the preliminary leaderboard, ranking within the top 10 teams.

However, models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training, while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing} strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model, further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | ACM MM25 |

After training, only the prompts are shared by the clients with the central server for aggregation. However, textual prompt tuning suffers from overfitting to known concepts, limiting its generalizability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on multimodal contextual information - derived from the input image and textual attribute features of a class. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer module that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through a cross-attention mechanism. The dynamically generated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder of CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a consistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets, spanning three generalization settings, demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance on in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher generalizability to unseen classes and domains, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin of +1.57% - 2.26%.

Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJCAI2025 Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel zero-shot image matting model, called ZIM, with two key contributions: First, we develop a label converter that transforms segmentation labels into detailed matte labels, constructing the new SA1B-Matte dataset without costly manual annotations. Training SAM with this dataset enables it to generate precise matte masks while maintaining its zero-shot capability. Second, we design the zero-shot matting model equipped with a hierarchical pixel decoder to enhance mask representation, along with a prompt-aware masked attention mechanism to improve performance by enabling the model to focus on regions specified by visual prompts. We evaluate ZIM using the newly introduced MicroMat-3K test set, which contains high-quality micro-level matte labels. Experimental results show that ZIM outperforms existing methods in fine-grained mask generation and zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of ZIM in various downstream tasks requiring precise masks, such as image inpainting and 3D NeRF. Our contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing zero-shot matting and its downstream applications across a wide range of computer vision tasks.

| **[Towards Instance-wise Personalized Federated Learning via Semi-Implicit Bayesian Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19621v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training across multiple distributed clients without disclosing their raw data. Personalized federated learning (pFL) has gained increasing attention for its ability to address data heterogeneity. However, most existing pFL methods assume that each client's data follows a single distribution and learn one client-level personalized model for each client. This assumption often fails in practice, where a single client may possess data from multiple sources or domains, resulting in significant intra-client heterogeneity and suboptimal performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise pFL framework based on visual prompt tuning. Specifically, we formulate instance-wise prompt generation from a Bayesian perspective and model the prompt posterior as an implicit distribution to capture diverse visual semantics. We derive a variational training objective under the semi-implicit variational inference framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that pFedBayesPT consistently outperforms existing pFL methods under both feature and label heterogeneity settings.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |

Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptGAR: Flexible Promptive Group Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08933v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PromptGAR, a novel framework for Group Activity Recognition (GAR) that offering both input flexibility and high recognition accuracy. The existing approaches suffer from limited real-world applicability due to their reliance on full prompt annotations, fixed number of frames and instances, and the lack of actor consistency. To bridge the gap, we proposed PromptGAR, which is the first GAR model to provide input flexibility across prompts, frames, and instances without the need for retraining. We leverage diverse visual prompts, like bounding boxes, skeletal keypoints, and instance identities, by unifying them as point prompts. A recognition decoder then cross-updates class and prompt tokens for enhanced performance. To ensure actor consistency for extended activity durations, we also introduce a relative instance attention mechanism that directly encodes instance identities. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PromptGAR achieves competitive performances both on full prompts and partial prompt inputs, establishing its effectiveness on input flexibility and generalization ability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[VPN: Visual Prompt Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01766v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation.

| **[PromptRR: Diffusion Models as Prompt Generators for Single Image Reflection Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02374v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing single image reflection removal (SIRR) methods using deep learning tend to miss key low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) differences in images, affecting their effectiveness in removing reflections. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel prompt-guided reflection removal (PromptRR) framework that uses frequency information as new visual prompts for better reflection performance. Specifically, the proposed framework decouples the reflection removal process into the prompt generation and subsequent prompt-guided restoration. For the prompt generation, we first propose a prompt pre-training strategy to train a frequency prompt encoder that encodes the ground-truth image into LF and HF prompts. Then, we adopt diffusion models (DMs) as prompt generators to generate the LF and HF prompts estimated by the pre-trained frequency prompt encoder. For the prompt-guided restoration, we integrate specially generated prompts into the PromptFormer network, employing a novel Transformer-based prompt block to effectively steer the model toward enhanced reflection removal. The results on commonly used benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/PromptRR.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Constrained Prompt Enhancement for Improving Zero-Shot Generalization of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17417v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components: Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model, effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts. Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSG-Dit: A Spatial Signal Guided Framework for Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17062v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control and overall consistency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Label Anything, a novel transformer-based architecture designed for multi-prompt, multi-way few-shot semantic segmentation. Our approach leverages diverse visual prompts -- points, bounding boxes, and masks -- to create a highly flexible and generalizable framework that significantly reduces annotation burden while maintaining high accuracy. Label Anything makes three key contributions: ($\textit{i}$) we introduce a new task formulation that relaxes conventional few-shot segmentation constraints by supporting various types of prompts, multi-class classification, and enabling multiple prompts within a single image; ($\textit{ii}$) we propose a novel architecture based on transformers and attention mechanisms; and ($\textit{iii}$) we design a versatile training procedure allowing our model to operate seamlessly across different $N$-way $K$-shot and prompt-type configurations with a single trained model. Our extensive experimental evaluation on the widely used COCO-$20^i$ benchmark demonstrates that Label Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing multi-way few-shot segmentation methods, while significantly outperforming leading single-class models when evaluated in multi-class settings.

However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically, DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) Dictionary Construction - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) Dictionary Lookup - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) Query Discrimination Regularization - to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, Project: https://github.com/xiaozhen228/DictAS</p></details> |

Action-driven video generation faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions (HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

In contrast, most existing robotic systems rely on carefully positioned fixed or multi-camera setups with complete scene visibility, which limits adaptability and incurs high hardware costs. We present \textbf{RoboRetriever}, a novel framework for real-world object retrieval that operates using only a \textbf{single} wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and free-form natural language instructions. RoboRetriever grounds visual observations to build and update a \textbf{dynamic hierarchical scene graph} that encodes object semantics, geometry, and inter-object relations over time. The supervisor module reasons over this memory and task instruction to infer the target object and coordinate an integrated action module combining \textbf{active perception}, \textbf{interactive perception}, and \textbf{manipulation}. To enable task-aware scene-grounded active perception, we introduce a novel visual prompting scheme that leverages large reasoning vision-language models to determine 6-DoF camera poses aligned with the semantic task goal and geometry scene context. We evaluate RoboRetriever on diverse real-world object retrieval tasks, including scenarios with human intervention, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness in cluttered scenes with only one RGB-D camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention to the Burstiness in Visual Prompt Tuning!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22908v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; v2: camera ready</p></details> |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks.

The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.</p></details> | Preprint |

In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

| **[Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14976v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations, we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities, enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11 benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at: https://github.com/zzeoZheng/HiCroPL.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2) \textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3) Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art training-free COS methods.</p></details> | under review |

The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA.

| **[Visual Prompting for Robotic Manipulation with Annotation-Guided Pick-and-Place Using ACT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08748v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm, enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and adaptability in retail environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning for Continual Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08612v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames. However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the alignment with instructions and realism in two ways. First, SPIE captures fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. Second, it achieves precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIE can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where targeted image edits enhance the visual realism of simulated environments, which improves their utility as proxy for real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language Models Fail to Identify Relative Positions in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00549v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite. Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o, Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset, designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative positions in medical images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP) model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints. Our work establishes a new paradigm for scalable multimodal detection and data generation in open-world scenarios.

| **[X-SAM: From Segment Anything to Any Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04655v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

| **[A Foundation Model for DAS Signal Recognition and Visual Prompt Tuning of the Pre-trained Model for Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04316v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder, named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples, encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322% of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT) method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality, efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal recognition models in the DAS domain.</p></details> |  |

However, current models risk overfitting to room environments and lose fine-grained spatial details. In this paper, we propose a new audio-visual binaural generation model incorporating an audio-visual conditional normalisation layer that dynamically aligns the mean and variance of the target difference audio features using visual context, along with a new contrastive learning method to enhance spatial sensitivity by mining negative samples from shuffled visual features. We also introduce a cost-efficient way to utilise test-time augmentation in video data to enhance performance.

Current AV-SSL methodologies typically require spatially-paired audio-visual data and cannot selectively localize specific target sources. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross-Instance Audio-Visual Localization (CI-AVL), a novel task that localizes target sound sources using visual prompts from different instances of the same semantic class. CI-AVL enables selective localization without spatially paired data. To solve this task, we propose AV-SSAN, a semantic-spatial alignment framework centered on a Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment Network (MB-SSA Net). MB-SSA Net decomposes the audio spectrogram into multiple frequency bands, aligns each band with semantic visual prompts, and refines spatial cues to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA). To facilitate this research, we construct VGGSound-SSL, a large-scale dataset comprising 13,981 spatial audio clips across 296 categories, each paired with visual prompts. AV-SSAN achieves a mean absolute error of 16.59 and an accuracy of 71.29%, significantly outperforming existing AV-SSL methods. Code and data will be public.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information. Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting.

However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

| **[SAMPO: Visual Preference Optimization for Intent-Aware Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02464v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO (Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning. Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9 percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted preference learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Disentangled Modeling of Trigger-Object Pairings for Backdoor Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01932v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Register Anything: Estimating "Corresponding Prompts" for Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01697v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images. In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models (e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X, such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts, inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and, as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.</p></details> |  |

However, the high-dimensional nature of dynamical systems leads to an exponentially expanding equation space, making the search process extremely challenging. The visual perception and pre-trained scientific knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLM) hold promise for providing effective navigation in high-dimensional equation spaces. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot method based on MLLM for automatically discovering physical coordinates and governing equations from high-dimensional data. Specifically, we design a series of enhanced visual prompts for MLLM to enhance its spatial perception. In addition, MLLM's domain knowledge is employed to navigate the search process within the equation space. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two representative types of systems demonstrate that the proposed method effectively discovers the physical coordinates and equations from both simulated and real experimental data, with long-term extrapolation accuracy improved by approximately 26.96% compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces GSON, a novel group-based social navigation framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance robots' social perception capabilities. Our approach uses visual prompting to enable zero-shot extraction of social relationships among pedestrians and integrates these results with robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipelines to overcome the inherent inference speed limitations of LMMs. The planning system incorporates a mid-level planner that sits between global path planning and local motion planning, effectively preserving both global context and reactive responsiveness while avoiding disruption of the predicted social group. We validate GSON through extensive real-world mobile robot navigation experiments involving complex social scenarios such as queuing, conversations, and photo sessions. Comparative results show that our system significantly outperforms existing navigation approaches in minimizing social perturbations while maintaining comparable performance on traditional navigation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA).

The system operates in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM).

However, existing models primarily focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses, restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video and image understanding.

However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as human demonstrations of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics that can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we present Keypoint-based Affordance Guidance for Improvements (KAGI), a method leveraging rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous RL. State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated impressive zero-shot reasoning about affordances through keypoints, and we use these to define dense rewards that guide autonomous robotic learning. On diverse real-world manipulation tasks specified by natural language descriptions, KAGI improves the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enables successful task completion in 30K online fine-tuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of KAGI to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pre-training, reaching similar performance in 45K online fine-tuning steps.

| **[Visual Adaptive Prompting for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20292v6)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives--such as attributes and objects--that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose a Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalization Toolkit: Training Free Personalization of Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02452v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) involves customizing models to recognize specific users and object instances, and to generate contextually tailored responses. Existing approaches typically rely on time-consuming test-time training for each user or object, making them impractical for real-world deployment, a limitation reflected in current personalization benchmarks, which are focused on object-centric, single-concept evaluations. In this paper, we present a novel training-free approach to LVLM personalization and introduce a comprehensive real-world benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate various aspects of the personalization task. Our method leverages pre-trained vision foundation models to extract distinctive features, applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to identify instances within visual inputs, and employs visual prompting strategies to guide model outputs. Our model-agnostic vision toolkit enables efficient and flexible multi-concept personalization across both images and videos, without any additional training. We achieve state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing training-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing 3D multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information.

However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in enhancing video comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Scalable Unified Modeling for General Low-Level Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14801v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible integration with various architectures and effective utilization of task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity. We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization, few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general low-level vision modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[CVPT: Cross Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14961v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged to mitigate the computational demands of large-scale models. Within computer vision, adapter-based PEFT methods are often favored over prompt-based approaches like Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) due to the latter's performance and efficiency limitations. Our analysis reveals that VPT's shortcomings stem from its prompt deployment strategy, which can distort the model's inherent self-attention mechanism. To address this, we propose Cross Visual Prompt Tuning (CVPT). CVPT introduces a cross-attention module to directly model interactions between prompts and image tokens. This design decouples the prompts from the input sequence, preserving the original self-attention integrity while enabling efficient feature integration. Furthermore, we employ a weight-sharing mechanism for cross-attention initialization, which enhances representative capability without a large parameter overhead. Extensive experiments across 25 datasets show that CVPT significantly outperforms VPT. For instance, on the VTAB-1K benchmark, CVPT achieves over 4% higher average accuracy, rivaling leading adapter-based methods in both performance and efficiency. Our work confirms that prompt-based methods can achieve exceptional results in visual fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/Lingyun0419/CVPT</p></details> |  |
| **[CycleSAM: Few-Shot Surgical Scene Segmentation with Cycle- and Scene-Consistent Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06795v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical image segmentation is highly challenging, primarily due to scarcity of annotated data. Generalist prompted segmentation models like the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) can help tackle this task, but because they require image-specific visual prompts for effective performance, their use is limited to improving data annotation efficiency. Recent approaches extend SAM to automatic segmentation by using a few labeled reference images to predict point prompts; however, they rely on feature matching pipelines that lack robustness to out-of-domain data like surgical images. To tackle this problem, we introduce CycleSAM, an improved visual prompt learning approach that employs a data-efficient training phase and enforces a series of soft constraints to produce high-quality feature similarity maps. CycleSAM label-efficiently addresses domain gap by leveraging surgery-specific self-supervised feature extractors, then adapts the resulting features through a short parameter-efficient training stage, enabling it to produce informative similarity maps. CycleSAM further filters the similarity maps with a series of consistency constraints before robustly sampling diverse point prompts for each object instance. In our experiments on four diverse surgical datasets, we find that CycleSAM outperforms existing few-shot SAM approaches by a factor of 2-4x in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, while also achieving strong performance gains over traditional linear probing, parameter-efficient adaptation, and pseudo-labeling methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Show and Polish: Reference-Guided Identity Preservation in Face Video Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10293v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained, identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process. This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips. Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation, showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video restoration.</p></details> | Accepted by MM 2025 |
| **[Benchmarking Unified Face Attack Detection via Hierarchical Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13327v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PAD and FFD are proposed to protect face data from physical media-based Presentation Attacks and digital editing-based DeepFakes, respectively. However, isolated training of these two models significantly increases vulnerability towards unknown attacks, burdening deployment environments. The lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to simultaneously handle attacks in these two categories is mainly attributed to two factors: (1) A benchmark that is sufficient for models to explore is lacking. Existing UAD datasets only contain limited attack types and samples, leading to the model's confined ability to address abundant advanced threats. In light of these, through an explainable hierarchical way, we propose the most extensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques available to date, namely UniAttackDataPlus. Our UniAttackData+ encompasses 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of corresponding falsified samples, in a total of 697,347 videos. (2) The absence of a trustworthy classification criterion. Current methods endeavor to explore an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic space, which fails to exist when encountering diverse attacks. Thus, we present a novel Visual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework that adaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic spaces. Specifically, we construct a VP-Tree to explore various classification rules hierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select the most suitable prompts guiding the encoder to extract discriminative features at different levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, to help the model understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a DPI module to project the visual prompts to the text encoder to help obtain a more accurate semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MP-HSIR: A Multi-Prompt Framework for Universal Hyperspectral Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09131v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from diverse and unknown degradations during imaging, leading to severe spectral and spatial distortions. Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context, and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals (facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics, others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |

We observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead, ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.</p></details> |  |

Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>homep...</summary><p>homepage: https://open-bee.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-MME: A Holistic Evaluation Benchmark for Human-Centric Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26165v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs.

However, the rapid growth of these datasets introduces significant redundancy, leading to increased computational costs. Existing methods for selecting instruction data aim to prune this redundancy, but predominantly rely on computationally demanding techniques such as proxy-based inference or training-based metrics. Consequently, the substantial computational costs incurred by these selection processes often exacerbate the very efficiency bottlenecks they are intended to resolve, posing a significant challenge to the scalable and effective tuning of MLLMs. To address this challenge, we first identify a critical, yet previously overlooked, factor: the anisotropy inherent in visual feature distributions. We find that this anisotropy induces a \textit{Global Semantic Drift}, and overlooking this phenomenon is a key factor limiting the efficiency of current data selection methods. Motivated by this insight, we devise \textbf{PRISM}, the first training-free framework for efficient visual instruction selection. PRISM surgically removes the corrupting influence of global background features by modeling the intrinsic visual semantics via implicit re-centering. Empirically, PRISM reduces the end-to-end time for data selection and model tuning to just 30\% of conventional pipelines. More remarkably, it achieves this efficiency while simultaneously enhancing performance, surpassing models fine-tuned on the full dataset across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, culminating in a 101.7\% relative improvement over the baseline. The code is available for access via \href{https://github.com/bibisbar/PRISM}{this repository}.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots, and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator, with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied intelligence in humanoid robotics.

Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Project Page, Code, and Dataset at: https://merit-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this, we propose the Hints of Prompt (HoP) framework, which introduces three key enhancements: Affinity hint to emphasize instance-level structure by strengthening token-wise connections, Semantic hint to incorporate high-level information relevant to driving-specific cases, such as complex interactions among vehicles and traffic signs, and Question hint to align visual features with the query context, focusing on question-relevant regions. These hints are fused through a Hint Fusion module, enriching visual representations by capturing driving-related representations with limited domain data, ensuring faster adaptation to driving scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the HoP framework, showing that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in all key metrics.</p></details> |  |

Despite this progress, their application in addressing earth science problems, especially at the graduate level, remains underexplored. A significant barrier is the absence of benchmarks that capture the depth and contextual complexity of geoscientific reasoning. Current benchmarks often rely on synthetic datasets or simplistic figure-caption pairs, which do not adequately reflect the intricate reasoning and domain-specific insights required for real-world scientific applications. To address these gaps, we introduce MSEarth, a multimodal scientific benchmark curated from high-quality, open-access scientific publications. MSEarth encompasses the five major spheres of Earth science: atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, featuring over 289K figures with refined captions. These captions are crafted from the original figure captions and enriched with discussions and reasoning from the papers, ensuring the benchmark captures the nuanced reasoning and knowledge-intensive content essential for advanced scientific tasks. MSEarth supports a variety of tasks, including scientific figure captioning, multiple choice questions, and open-ended reasoning challenges.

| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

Inspired by the recent success of RL in both LLMs and MLLMs, in this paper, we explore how RL can enhance visual perception ability of MLLMs. Then we develop a novel RL-based framework, Deep Inspection and Perception with RL (DIP-R1) designed to enhance the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs, by comprehending complex scenes and looking through visual instances closely. DIP-R1 guides MLLMs through detailed inspection of visual scene via three simply designed rule-based reward modeling. First, we adopt a standard reasoning reward encouraging the model to include three-step reasoning process: 1) comprehending entire visual scene, 2) observing for looking through interested but ambiguous regions, and 3) decision-making for predicting answer. Second, a variance-guided looking reward is designed to encourage MLLM to examine uncertain regions during the observing process, guiding it to inspect ambiguous areas and mitigate perceptual uncertainty. This reward promotes variance-driven visual exploration, enabling MLLM to reason about region-level uncertainty and explicitly indicate interpretable uncertain regions. Third, we model a weighted precision-recall accuracy reward enhancing accurate decision-making. We verify its effectiveness across diverse fine-grained object detection data consisting of challenging real-world scenes, such as densely crowded scenes. Built upon existing MLLMs, DIP-R1 achieves consistent and significant improvement across various in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, outperforming various existing baselines and SFT method. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating RL into MLLMs for enhancing capabilities in complex real-world perception tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-Token Diffusion for Speaker-Referenced TTS in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12995v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified architectures in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have shown promise in handling diverse tasks within a single framework. In the text-to-speech (TTS) task, current MLLM-based approaches rely on discrete token representations, which disregard the inherently continuous nature of speech and can lead to loss of fine-grained acoustic information.In this work, we investigate the TTS within the MLLM paradigm using continuous speech representations. We design a dual-head architecture and implement two complementary training strategies for a robust model. (1) A diffusion head generating continuous speech representations is added on the MLLM, which is on frame-level and strictly autoregressive. (2) The original language model head is retained to preserve multitask capability and to control the start and end of speech synthesis. (3) Masked training is employed to address exposure bias in autoregressive decoding. (4) To stabilize optimization, we propose a two-stage scheme where the LM is frozen in the second stage, ensuring the diffusion head learns from a fixed input distribution. Evaluations on LibriSpeech(PC) test-clean show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art autoregressive performance, with a WER of 1.95%, speaker similarity of 0.54, and UTMOS of 4.00. The two-stage training yields a 46% relative WER reduction over the one-stage training baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining autoregressive modeling with continuous-token diffusion, supported by a two-stage training procedure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1, the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools. Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detect Anything via Next Point Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12798v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>homep...</summary><p>homepage: https://rex-omni.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12793v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs. In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch. Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[VQArt-Bench: A semantically rich VQA Benchmark for Art and Cultural Heritage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12750v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis. Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Seeing: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Tool-Enabled Image Perception, Transformation, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12712v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS, an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning in the Dark: Interleaved Vision-Text Reasoning in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12603v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.

This small-data regime is vital for applications requiring expensive expert annotations, such as ecological monitoring, medical diagnostics or industrial quality control. We find, however, that computer vision research has ignored the small data regime as evaluations increasingly focus on zero- and few-shot learning. We use the Natural World Tasks (NeWT) benchmark to compare multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and vision-only methods across varying training set sizes. MLLMs exhibit early performance plateaus, while vision-only methods improve throughout the small-data regime, with performance gaps widening beyond 10 training examples. We provide the first comprehensive comparison between these approaches in small-data contexts and advocate for explicit small-data evaluations in AI research to better bridge theoretical advances with practical deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages (main text), 3 figures.

To fill this gap, we propose VideoRFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VideoRFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a multi-expert-driven, cognition-inspired CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognition-inspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a MLLM conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets, i.e.VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VideoRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures.

Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 18 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.</p></details> |  |

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos. EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

However, it remains unclear which video representations are most effective for MLLMs, and how different modalities balance task accuracy against computational efficiency. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study of video representation methods for VideoQA with MLLMs. We systematically evaluate single modality inputs question only, subtitles, visual frames, and audio signals as well as multimodal combinations, on two widely used benchmarks: VideoMME and LongVideoBench. Our results show that visual frames substantially enhance accuracy but impose heavy costs in GPU memory and inference latency, while subtitles provide a lightweight yet effective alternative, particularly for long videos. These findings highlight clear trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency and provide practical insights for designing resource-aware MLLM-based VideoQA systems.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing benchmarks primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images, covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format. SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Inspired by human psychophysics, we introduce a behavioural method for estimating the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) in MLLMs by treating them as end-to-end observers. Models are queried with structured prompts while viewing noise-based stimuli filtered at specific spatial frequencies. Psychometric functions are derived from the binary verbal responses, and contrast thresholds (and CSFs) are obtained without relying on internal activations or classifier-based proxies. Our results reveal that some models resemble human CSFs in shape or scale, but none capture both. We also find that CSF estimates are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, indicating limited linguistic robustness. Finally, we show that CSFs predict model performance under frequency-filtered and adversarial conditions. These findings highlight systematic differences in frequency tuning across MLLMs and establish CSF estimation as a scalable diagnostic tool for multimodal perception.</p></details> |  |

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and data-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles.

In this regard, the knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative, which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model (teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 27 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoRA architecture alongside a Quantization-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning (QALFT) framework to facilitate efficient task adaptation and model compression during mobile-side deployment of AndesVL. Moreover, utilizing our cache eviction algorithm -- OKV -- along with customized speculative decoding and compression strategies, we achieve a 6.7x peak decoding speedup ratio, up to 30.9% memory reduction, and 1.8 bits-per-weight when deploying AndesVL-4B on MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chips. We release all models on https://huggingface.co/OPPOer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report of OPPO AndesVL Team</p></details> |

Multi-turn dialogues, which are more common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts; however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index (SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed guard models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11693v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at https://github.com/LCO-Embedding/LCO-Embedding.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process: (1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19 leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data & Code: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ExpVid</p></details> |

While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10 fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20 representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages 11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning as Representation: Rethinking Visual Reinforcement Learning in Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11369v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.</p></details> |  |

In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.</p></details> |  |

We constructed a database of approximately 3,000 anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a `Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task, a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025 MLLMCP Workshop</p></details> |

However, automating Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuit design has remained a longstanding challenge due to its difficulty and complexity. Although recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising potential for supporting AMS circuit analysis and design, current research typically evaluates MLLMs on isolated tasks within the domain, lacking a comprehensive benchmark that systematically assesses model capabilities across diverse AMS-related challenges. To address this gap, we introduce AMSbench, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate MLLM performance across critical tasks including circuit schematic perception, circuit analysis, and circuit design. AMSbench comprises approximately 8000 test questions spanning multiple difficulty levels and assesses eight prominent models, encompassing both open-source and proprietary solutions such as Qwen 2.5-VL and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Our evaluation highlights significant limitations in current MLLMs, particularly in complex multi-modal reasoning and sophisticated circuit design tasks. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' understanding and effective application of circuit-specific knowledge, thereby narrowing the existing performance gap relative to human expertise and moving toward fully automated AMS circuit design workflows.

However, their multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex multimodal tasks. In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies. Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of MLLMs in real world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, they are often published as static raster images, losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation, enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine understanding of scientific graphics.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM '25)</p></details> |
| **[Tailored Teaching with Balanced Difficulty: Elevating Reasoning in Multimodal Chain-of-Thought via Prompt Curriculum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18673v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1) model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and (2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Besides the two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting, etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient, language-aware video segmentation in the wild.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

However, the community still lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency (GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset, we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at \href{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}.</p></details> |  |

They are often more complex than general videos of similar duration due to their structured narratives and rapid scene transitions, posing significant challenges to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we introduce VideoAds, the first dataset tailored for benchmarking the performance of MLLMs on advertisement videos. VideoAds comprises well-curated advertisement videos with complex temporal structures, accompanied by \textbf{manually} annotated diverse questions across three core tasks: visual finding, video summary, and visual reasoning. We propose a quantitative measure to compare VideoAds against existing benchmarks in terms of video complexity. Through extensive experiments, we find that Qwen2.5-VL-72B, an opensource MLLM, achieves 73.35\% accuracy on VideoAds, outperforming GPT-4o (66.82\%) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (69.66\%); the two proprietary models especially fall behind the opensource model in video summarization and reasoning, but perform the best in visual finding. Notably, human experts easily achieve a remarkable accuracy of 94.27\%. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' temporal modeling capabilities and highlight VideoAds as a potentially pivotal benchmark for future research in understanding video that requires high FPS sampling.

Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also actively update a public repository at https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset. Code, model, and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in false premise recognition.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

To address this, we first build lightweight captioning models using a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluate their performance not only on single-sentence but on detailed captioning tasks. We obtain surprising results showing that our model can achieve performance comparable to MLLMs, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong captioning specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from occasional captioning errors. We investigate the underlying causes and observe that the problems stem from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality by refining coarse descriptions into more precise captions.

However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization, counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable, high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible, articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures (e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks. Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19147v3)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on scaling model parameters. However, as hardware limits constrain further model growth, the primary computational bottleneck has shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over increasingly long sequences by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position data-centric compression as the emerging paradigm, which improves AI efficiency by directly compressing the volume of data processed during model training or inference. To formalize this shift, we establish a unified framework for existing efficiency strategies and demonstrate why it constitutes a crucial paradigm change for long-context AI. We then systematically review the landscape of data-centric compression methods, analyzing their benefits across diverse scenarios. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising future research directions. Our work aims to provide a novel perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing efforts, and catalyze innovation to address the challenges posed by ever-increasing context lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: \url{https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/Awesome-Token-level-Model-Compression}</p></details> |
| **[Taming a Retrieval Framework to Read Images in Humanlike Manner for Augmenting Generation of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10426v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities, positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors, but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment (reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward trustworthy reasoning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReMix: Towards a Unified View of Consistent Character Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10156v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1) have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts, pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.</p></details> |  |

While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.</p></details> |  |

While VIT equips Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with promising multimodal capabilities, the current design choices for VIT often result in overfitting and shortcut learning, potentially degrading performance. This gap arises from an overemphasis on instruction-following abilities, while neglecting the proactive understanding of visual information. Inspired by this, L2T adopts a simple yet effective approach by incorporating the loss function into both the instruction and response sequences. It seamlessly expands the training data, and regularizes the MLLMs from overly relying on language priors. Based on this merit, L2T achieves a significant relative improvement of up to 9% on comprehensive multimodal benchmarks, requiring no additional training data and incurring negligible computational overhead. Surprisingly, L2T attains exceptional fundamental visual capabilities, yielding up to an 18% improvement in captioning performance, while simultaneously alleviating hallucination in MLLMs. Github code: https://github.com/Feng-Hong/L2T.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2025 Oral Code: https://github.com/ZhiyuanHan-Aaron/MoSEAR Project Page: https://zhiyuanhan-aaron.github.io/MoSEAR-page/</p></details> |

This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Although effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task. Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness, providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning. These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for video-language modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia Asia 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we first conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability. Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Then Embed: Generative Context Improves Multimodal Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05014v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally, extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench, demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across all scales and scenarios.

We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas, all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image, reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important, without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when given such warped inputs.</p></details> |  |

For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Merging models into one universal model to empower multi-task ability refraining from data leakage has gained popularity. With the expansion in data and model size, parameter-efficient tuning becomes the common practice for obtaining task-specific models efficiently. However, few methods are dedicated to efficient merging, and existing methods designed for full fine-tuning merging fail under efficient merging. To address the issue, we analyze from low-rank decomposition and reveal that direction robustness during merging is crucial for merging efficient modules. We furthermore uncover that compensating for the gap between stark singular values contributes to direction robustness. Therefore, we propose RobustMerge, a training-free parameter-efficient merging method with complementary parameter adaptation to maintain direction robustness. Specifically, we (1) prune parameters and scale coefficients from inter-parameter relation for singular values to maintain direction stability away from task interference, and (2) perform cross-task normalization to enhance unseen task generalization. We establish a benchmark consisting of diverse multimodal tasks, on which we conduct experiments to certify the outstanding performance and generalizability of our method. Additional studies and extensive analyses further showcase the effectiveness.

A Reasoning Benchmark on Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09361v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress, particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models. BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules.

In this paper, we introduce a new problem, Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description. Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new challenging problem.</p></details> |  |

While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[CapGeo: A Caption-Assisted Approach to Geometric Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09302v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under review</p></details> |

Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity, often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale, manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos, yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials, requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all evaluated MLLMs</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnosing Shoulder Disorders Using Multimodal Large Language Models and Consumer-Grade Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09230v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis), are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.</p></details> |  |

However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

| **[Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07979v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |
| **[Don't Just Chase "Highlighted Tokens" in MLLMs: Revisiting Visual Holistic Context Retention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02912v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or [\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 main</p></details> |

However, research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking. To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them. Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, Code will be available at https://github.com/buptyqx/Tiny-R1V</p></details> |

Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Scheduling for Multi-Vector Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08976v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications. However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval - HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment. Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.</p></details> | Under Review |

Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of 0.90 on GenEval, 0.63 on WISE, and 3.94 on ImgEdit. These results demonstrate that UniLIP successfully expands the application of CLIP, establishing its continuous features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

However, their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD) counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73% performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The code and data will be released shortly.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising opportunity to act as early evaluators, helping designers narrow options before formal testing. Unlike prior work that emphasizes user behavior in narrow domains such as e-commerce with metrics like clicks or conversions, we focus on subjective user evaluations across varied interfaces. We investigate whether MLLMs can mimic human preferences when evaluating individual UIs and comparing them. Using data from a crowdsourcing platform, we benchmark GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama across 30 interfaces and examine alignment with human judgments on multiple UI factors. Our results show that MLLMs approximate human preferences on some dimensions but diverge on others, underscoring both their potential and limitations in supplementing early UX research.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across 14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated environments.

Among their most critical applications is operating system (OS) control. As CUAs in the OS domain become increasingly embedded in daily operations, it is imperative to examine their real-world security implications, specifically whether CUAs can be misused to perform realistic, security-relevant attacks. Existing works exhibit four major limitations: Missing attacker-knowledge model on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), Incomplete coverage for end-to-end kill chains, unrealistic environment without multi-host and encrypted user credentials, and unreliable judgment dependent on LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these gaps, we propose AdvCUA, the first benchmark aligned with real-world TTPs in MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix, which comprises 140 tasks, including 40 direct malicious tasks, 74 TTP-based malicious tasks, and 26 end-to-end kill chains, systematically evaluates CUAs under a realistic enterprise OS security threat in a multi-host environment sandbox by hard-coded evaluation. We evaluate the existing five mainstream CUAs, including ReAct, AutoGPT, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, and Cursor IDE based on 8 foundation LLMs. The results demonstrate that current frontier CUAs do not adequately cover OS security-centric threats. These capabilities of CUAs reduce dependence on custom malware and deep domain expertise, enabling even inexperienced attackers to mount complex enterprise intrusions, which raises social concern about the responsibility and security of CUAs.</p></details> |  |

However, the multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that, we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs. Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a simple and cost-effective recipe.

Motivated by literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable reasoning skills, we propose a novel post-training method, Visual Game Learning (ViGaL), where MLLMs develop generalizable reasoning skills through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple games like Snake significantly enhances the downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, on multi-discipline questions like MMMU and on 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks like VSI-Bench, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models post-trained on benchmark-oriented multimodal reasoning data, while preserving the model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest that multimodal reasoning can emerge from gameplay, pointing to a promising strategy of designing surrogate tasks for RL post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunfeixie233.github.io/ViGaL/</p></details> |

Despite rapid progress, most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination. Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent robustness and generalization.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website https://congwei1230.github.io/UniVideo/</p></details> |

They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA, the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset.

| **[CIR-CoT: Towards Interpretable Composed Image Retrieval via End-to-End Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08003v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption, reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset, establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PiCo: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Pictorial Code Contextualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01444v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate vision and other modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhance AI capabilities but also introduce new security vulnerabilities. By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results highlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more robust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) 2025</p></details> |
