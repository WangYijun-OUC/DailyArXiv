| **[CrossFusion: A Multi-Scale Cross-Attention Convolutional Fusion Model for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02064v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer survival prediction from whole slide images (WSIs) is a challenging task in computational pathology due to the large size, irregular shape, and high granularity of the WSIs. These characteristics make it difficult to capture the full spectrum of patterns, from subtle cellular abnormalities to complex tissue interactions, which are crucial for accurate prognosis. To address this, we propose CrossFusion, a novel multi-scale feature integration framework that extracts and fuses information from patches across different magnification levels. By effectively modeling both scale-specific patterns and their interactions, CrossFusion generates a rich feature set that enhances survival prediction accuracy. We validate our approach across six cancer types from public datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, when coupled with domain-specific feature extraction backbones, our method shows further gains in prognostic performance compared to general-purpose backbones.

| **[Foundation Models -- A Panacea for Artificial Intelligence in Pathology?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21264v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948; updated authors list format</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Accurate Gigapixel Pathological Image Classification with Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21130v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to processing numerous patches from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). To address this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance learning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance pre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In addition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based Kolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the performance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Classifier for Malignant Lymphoma Subtyping via Cell Graph and Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00925v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malignant lymphoma subtype classification directly impacts treatment strategies and patient outcomes, necessitating classification models that achieve both high accuracy and sufficient explainability. This study proposes a novel explainable Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) framework that identifies subtype-specific Regions of Interest (ROIs) from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) while integrating cell distribution characteristics and image information. Our framework simultaneously addresses three objectives: (1) indicating appropriate ROIs for each subtype, (2) explaining the frequency and spatial distribution of characteristic cell types, and (3) achieving high-accuracy subtyping by leveraging both image and cell-distribution modalities. The proposed method fuses cell graph and image features extracted from each patch in the WSI using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach and classifies subtypes within an MIL framework. Experiments on a dataset of 1,233 WSIs demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among ten comparative methods and provides region-level and cell-level explanations that align with a pathologist's perspectives.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figure |
| **[Multimodal Distillation-Driven Ensemble Learning for Long-Tailed Histopathology Whole Slide Images Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00915v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) plays a significant role in computational pathology, enabling weakly supervised analysis of Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets. The field of WSI analysis is confronted with a severe long-tailed distribution problem, which significantly impacts the performance of classifiers. Long-tailed distributions lead to class imbalance, where some classes have sparse samples while others are abundant, making it difficult for classifiers to accurately identify minority class samples. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble learning method based on MIL, which employs expert decoders with shared aggregators and consistency constraints to learn diverse distributions and reduce the impact of class imbalance on classifier performance. Moreover, we introduce a multimodal distillation framework that leverages text encoders pre-trained on pathology-text pairs to distill knowledge and guide the MIL aggregator in capturing stronger semantic features relevant to class information. To ensure flexibility, we use learnable prompts to guide the distillation process of the pre-trained text encoder, avoiding limitations imposed by specific prompts. Our method, MDE-MIL, integrates multiple expert branches focusing on specific data distributions to address long-tailed issues. Consistency control ensures generalization across classes. Multimodal distillation enhances feature extraction. Experiments on Camelyon+-LT and PANDA-LT datasets show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Snuffy: Efficient Whole Slide Image Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08258v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies. The code is available on https://github.com/jafarinia/snuffy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **["No negatives needed": weakly-supervised regression for interpretable tumor detection in whole-slide histopathology images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21109v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate tumor detection in digital pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as a widely used approach for weakly-supervised tumor detection with large-scale data without the need for manual annotations. However, traditional MIL methods often depend on classification tasks that require tumor-free cases as negative examples, which are challenging to obtain in real-world clinical workflows, especially for surgical resection specimens. We address this limitation by reformulating tumor detection as a regression task, estimating tumor percentages from WSIs, a clinically available target across multiple cancer types. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the proposed weakly-supervised regression framework by applying it to multiple organs, specimen types and clinical scenarios. We characterize the robustness of our framework to tumor percentage as a noisy regression target, and introduce a novel concept of amplification technique to improve tumor detection sensitivity when learning from small tumor regions. Finally, we provide interpretable insights into the model's predictions by analyzing visual attention and logit maps. Our code is available at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/tumor-percentage-mil-regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid deep learning-based strategy for the hepatocellular carcinoma cancer grade classification of H&E stained liver histopathology images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03084v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of liver cancer whose early-stage diagnosis is a common challenge, mainly due to the manual assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images, which is a time-consuming process and may lead to variability in decision-making. For accurate detection of HCC, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based architecture that uses transfer learning to extract the features from pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and a classifier made up of a sequence of fully connected layers. This study uses a publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC)database (n=491) for model development and database of Kasturba Gandhi Medical College (KMC), India for validation. The pre-processing step involves patch extraction, colour normalization, and augmentation that results in 3920 patches for the TCGA dataset. The developed hybrid deep neural network consisting of a CNN-based pre-trained feature extractor and a customized artificial neural network-based classifier is trained using five-fold cross-validation. For this study, eight different state-of-the-art models are trained and tested as feature extractors for the proposed hybrid model. The proposed hybrid model with ResNet50-based feature extractor provided the sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 1.00, respectively on the TCGA database. On the KMC database, EfficientNetb3 resulted in the optimal choice of the feature extractor giving sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 96.97, 98.85, 96.71, 96.71, and 0.99, respectively. The proposed hybrid models showed improvement in accuracy of 2% and 4% over the pre-trained models in TCGA-LIHC and KMC databases.</p></details> | 14 figure, 9 tables |
| **[VLEER: Vision and Language Embeddings for Explainable Whole Slide Image Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20850v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable potential in bridging visual and textual modalities. In computational pathology, domain-specific VLMs, which are pre-trained on extensive histopathology image-text datasets, have succeeded in various downstream tasks. However, existing research has primarily focused on the pre-training process and direct applications of VLMs on the patch level, leaving their great potential for whole slide image (WSI) applications unexplored. In this study, we hypothesize that pre-trained VLMs inherently capture informative and interpretable WSI representations through quantitative feature extraction. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce Vision and Language Embeddings for Explainable WSI Representation (VLEER), a novel method designed to leverage VLMs for WSI representation. We systematically evaluate VLEER on three pathological WSI datasets, proving its better performance in WSI analysis compared to conventional vision features. More importantly, VLEER offers the unique advantage of interpretability, enabling direct human-readable insights into the results by leveraging the textual modality for detailed pathology annotations, providing clear reasoning for WSI-level pathology downstream tasks.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Robust sensitivity control in digital pathology via tile score distribution matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20144v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying digital pathology models across medical centers is challenging due to distribution shifts. Recent advances in domain generalization improve model transferability in terms of aggregated performance measured by the Area Under Curve (AUC). However, clinical regulations often require to control the transferability of other metrics, such as prescribed sensitivity levels. We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Validated across multiple cohorts and tasks, our method enables robust sensitivity control with only a handful of calibration samples, providing a practical solution for reliable deployment of computational pathology systems.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Can We Simplify Slide-level Fine-tuning of Pathology Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20823v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed histopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis being a core application. Traditionally, weakly supervised fine-tuning via multiple instance learning (MIL) has been the primary method for adapting foundation models to WSIs. However, in this work we present a key experimental finding: a simple nonlinear mapping strategy combining mean pooling and a multilayer perceptron, called SiMLP, can effectively adapt patch-level foundation models to slide-level tasks without complex MIL-based learning. Through extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of SiMLP with state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on a large-scale pan-cancer classification task, SiMLP surpasses popular MIL-based methods by 3.52%. Furthermore, SiMLP shows strong learning ability in few-shot classification and remaining highly competitive with slide-level foundation models pretrained on tens of thousands of slides. Finally, SiMLP exhibits remarkable robustness and transferability in lung cancer subtyping. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional MIL-based fine-tuning paradigm, demonstrating that a task-agnostic representation strategy alone can effectively adapt foundation models to WSI analysis. These insights offer a unique and meaningful perspective for future research in digital pathology, paving the way for more efficient and broadly applicable methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Pathology Report Generation and Multimodal Representation Learning for Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19293v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of melanocytic skin lesions are examined by pathologists each year, the majority of which concern common nevi (i.e., ordinary moles). While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study. While report generation revealed to be more difficult for rare melanocytic lesion subtypes, the cross-modal retrieval performance for these cases was considerably better.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.19285</p></details> |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[A Lightweight and Extensible Cell Segmentation and Classification Model for Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19217v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing clinically useful cell-level analysis tools in digital pathology remains challenging due to limitations in dataset granularity, inconsistent annotations, high computational demands, and difficulties integrating new technologies into workflows. To address these issues, we propose a solution that enhances data quality, model performance, and usability by creating a lightweight, extensible cell segmentation and classification model. First, we update data labels through cross-relabeling to refine annotations of PanNuke and MoNuSAC, producing a unified dataset with seven distinct cell types. Second, we leverage the H-Optimus foundation model as a fixed encoder to improve feature representation for simultaneous segmentation and classification tasks. Third, to address foundation models' computational demands, we distill knowledge to reduce model size and complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Finally, we integrate the distilled model into QuPath, a widely used open-source digital pathology platform. Results demonstrate improved segmentation and classification performance using the H-Optimus-based model compared to a CNN-based model. Specifically, average $R^2$ improved from 0.575 to 0.871, and average $PQ$ score improved from 0.450 to 0.492, indicating better alignment with actual cell counts and enhanced segmentation quality. The distilled model maintains comparable performance while reducing parameter count by a factor of 48. By reducing computational complexity and integrating into workflows, this approach may significantly impact diagnostics, reduce pathologist workload, and improve outcomes. Although the method shows promise, extensive validation is necessary prior to clinical deployment.</p></details> | 27 pages, 11 figures |
| **[From Traditional to Deep Learning Approaches in Whole Slide Image Registration: A Methodological Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19123v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) registration is an essential task for analysing the tumour microenvironment (TME) in histopathology. It involves the alignment of spatial information between WSIs of the same section or serial sections of a tissue sample. The tissue sections are usually stained with single or multiple biomarkers before imaging, and the goal is to identify neighbouring nuclei along the Z-axis for creating a 3D image or identifying subclasses of cells in the TME. This task is considerably more challenging compared to radiology image registration, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, due to various factors. These include gigapixel size of images, variations in appearance between differently stained tissues, changes in structure and morphology between non-consecutive sections, and the presence of artefacts, tears, and deformations. Currently, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding a review of the current approaches and their limitations, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the available approaches and their application for various purposes. Furthermore, we investigate current deep learning methods used for WSI registration, emphasising their diverse methodologies. We examine the available datasets and explore tools and software employed in the field. Finally, we identify open challenges and potential future trends in this area of research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Computational Pathology Foundation Models: Datasets, Adaptation Strategies, and Evaluation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15724v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology foundation models (CPathFMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for analyzing histopathological data, leveraging self-supervised learning to extract robust feature representations from unlabeled whole-slide images. These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Automatic Content-Aware Tiling Pipeline for Pathology Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16885v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the use of deep learning (DL) methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced computational pathology, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Whole Slide Images (WSI) plays a crucial role by providing detailed tissue samples for the analysis and training of DL models. However, WSIs often contain regions with artifacts such as tissue folds, blurring, as well as non-tissue regions (background), which can negatively impact DL model performance. These artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant and can lead to inaccurate results. This paper proposes a fully automatic supervised DL pipeline for WSI Quality Assessment (WSI-QA) that uses a fused model combining CNNs and ViTs to detect and exclude WSI regions with artifacts, ensuring that only qualified WSI regions are used to build DL-based computational pathology applications. The proposed pipeline employs a pixel-based segmentation model to classify WSI regions as either qualified or non-qualified based on the presence of artifacts. The proposed model was trained on a large and diverse dataset and validated with internal and external data from various human organs, scanners, and H&E staining procedures. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WSI artifact detection. The proposed model consistently achieved over 95% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across all artifact types. Furthermore, the WSI-QA pipeline shows strong generalization across different tissue types and scanning conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis journal, February 2025</p></details> |
| **[A deep learning framework for efficient pathology image analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13027v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed digital pathology by enabling biomarker prediction from high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs). However, current methods are computationally inefficient, processing thousands of redundant tiles per WSI and requiring complex aggregator models. We introduce EAGLE (Efficient Approach for Guided Local Examination), a deep learning framework that emulates pathologists by selectively analyzing informative regions. EAGLE incorporates two foundation models: CHIEF for efficient tile selection and Virchow2 for extracting high-quality features. Benchmarking was conducted against leading slide- and tile-level foundation models across 31 tasks from four cancer types, spanning morphology, biomarker prediction and prognosis. EAGLE outperformed state-of-the-art foundation models by up to 23% and achieved the highest AUROC overall. It processed a slide in 2.27 seconds, reducing computational time by more than 99% compared to existing models. This efficiency enables real-time workflows, allows pathologists to validate all tiles which are used by the model during analysis, and eliminates dependence on high-performance computing, making AI-powered pathology more accessible. By reliably identifying meaningful regions and minimizing artifacts, EAGLE provides robust and interpretable outputs, supporting rapid slide searches, integration into multi-omics pipelines and emerging clinical foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolyPath: Adapting a Large Multimodal Model for Multi-slide Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10536v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of histopathology cases underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions in medicine. Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[PathFinder: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent System for Medical Diagnostic Decision-Making Applied to Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08916v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing diseases through histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is fundamental in modern pathology but is challenged by the gigapixel scale and complexity of WSIs. Trained histopathologists overcome this challenge by navigating the WSI, looking for relevant patches, taking notes, and compiling them to produce a final holistic diagnostic. Traditional AI approaches, such as multiple instance learning and transformer-based models, fail short of such a holistic, iterative, multi-scale diagnostic procedure, limiting their adoption in the real-world. We introduce PathFinder, a multi-modal, multi-agent framework that emulates the decision-making process of expert pathologists. PathFinder integrates four AI agents, the Triage Agent, Navigation Agent, Description Agent, and Diagnosis Agent, that collaboratively navigate WSIs, gather evidence, and provide comprehensive diagnoses with natural language explanations. The Triage Agent classifies the WSI as benign or risky; if risky, the Navigation and Description Agents iteratively focus on significant regions, generating importance maps and descriptive insights of sampled patches. Finally, the Diagnosis Agent synthesizes the findings to determine the patient's diagnostic classification. Our Experiments show that PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skin melanoma diagnosis by 8% while offering inherent explainability through natural language descriptions of diagnostically relevant patches. Qualitative analysis by pathologists shows that the Description Agent's outputs are of high quality and comparable to GPT-4o. PathFinder is also the first AI-based system to surpass the average performance of pathologists in this challenging melanoma classification task by 9%, setting a new record for efficient, accurate, and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostics in pathology.

| **[ViLa-MIL: Dual-scale Vision-Language Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08391v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream for processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and hierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Cervical Cancer Screening via Large-scale Pretraining and Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09662v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cervical cancer is a leading malignancy in female reproductive system. While AI-assisted cytology offers a cost-effective and non-invasive screening solution, current systems struggle with generalizability in complex clinical scenarios. To address this issue, we introduced Smart-CCS, a generalizable Cervical Cancer Screening paradigm based on pretraining and adaptation to create robust and generalizable screening systems. To develop and validate Smart-CCS, we first curated a large-scale, multi-center dataset named CCS-127K, which comprises a total of 127,471 cervical cytology whole-slide images collected from 48 medical centers. By leveraging large-scale self-supervised pretraining, our CCS models are equipped with strong generalization capability, potentially generalizing across diverse scenarios. Then, we incorporated test-time adaptation to specifically optimize the trained CCS model for complex clinical settings, which adapts and refines predictions, improving real-world applicability. We conducted large-scale system evaluation among various cohorts. In retrospective cohorts, Smart-CCS achieved an overall area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.965 and sensitivity of 0.913 for cancer screening on 11 internal test datasets. In external testing, system performance maintained high at 0.950 AUC across 6 independent test datasets. In prospective cohorts, our Smart-CCS achieved AUCs of 0.947, 0.924, and 0.986 in three prospective centers, respectively. Moreover, the system demonstrated superior sensitivity in diagnosing cervical cancer, confirming the accuracy of our cancer screening results by using histology findings for validation. Interpretability analysis with cell and slide predictions further indicated that the system's decision-making aligns with clinical practice. Smart-CCS represents a significant advancement in cancer screening across diverse clinical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Accurate cancer classification is essential for patient stratification and clinical decision-making. Although digital pathology has been advancing cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the paradigm in cancer pathology has shifted from purely relying on histology features to incorporating molecular markers. There is an urgent need for digital pathology methods to meet the needs of the new paradigm. We introduce a novel digital pathology approach to jointly predict molecular markers and histology features and model their interactions for cancer classification. Firstly, to mitigate the challenge of cross-magnification information propagation, we propose a multi-scale disentangling module, enabling the extraction of multi-scale features from high-magnification (cellular-level) to low-magnification (tissue-level) whole slide images. Further, based on the multi-scale features, we propose an attention-based hierarchical multi-task multi-instance learning framework to simultaneously predict histology and molecular markers. Moreover, we propose a co-occurrence probability-based label correlation graph network to model the co-occurrence of molecular markers. Lastly, we design a cross-modal interaction module with the dynamic confidence constrain loss and a cross-modal gradient modulation strategy, to model the interactions of histology and molecular markers. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying glioma, histology features and molecular markers. Our method promises to promote precise oncology with the potential to advance biomedical research and clinical applications.

| **[Interpretable Vision-Language Survival Analysis with Ordinal Inductive Bias for Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09369v4)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) provide an important tool to assess cancer prognosis in computational pathology (CPATH). While existing survival analysis (SA) approaches have made exciting progress, they are generally limited to adopting highly-expressive network architectures and only coarse-grained patient-level labels to learn visual prognostic representations from gigapixel WSIs. Such learning paradigm suffers from critical performance bottlenecks, when facing present scarce training data and standard multi-instance learning (MIL) framework in CPATH. To overcome it, this paper, for the first time, proposes a new Vision-Language-based SA (VLSA) paradigm. Concretely, (1) VLSA is driven by pathology VL foundation models. It no longer relies on high-capability networks and shows the advantage of data efficiency. (2) In vision-end, VLSA encodes textual prognostic prior and then employs it as auxiliary signals to guide the aggregating of visual prognostic features at instance level, thereby compensating for the weak supervision in MIL. Moreover, given the characteristics of SA, we propose i) ordinal survival prompt learning to transform continuous survival labels into textual prompts; and ii) ordinal incidence function as prediction target to make SA compatible with VL-based prediction. Notably, VLSA's predictions can be interpreted intuitively by our Shapley values-based method. The extensive experiments on five datasets confirm the effectiveness of our scheme. Our VLSA could pave a new way for SA in CPATH by offering weakly-supervised MIL an effective means to learn valuable prognostic clues from gigapixel WSIs.

However, training such models typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain experts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay annotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-agent-based approaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively, as they lack mechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both the image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware self-corrective AI agent that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its learning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and annotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with stronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted based on their feature similarity to high-confidence agreement regions, with more similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of reliable agreement regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm enables the AI to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness. Validated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two simulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation performance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its potential for training robust models on noisy datasets. The official implementation and cell annotations are publicly available at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/CASC-AI.</p></details> |  |

While kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for CKD diagnosis and treatment, the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for kidney pathology segmentation hinders progress in the field. To address this, we organized the Kidney Pathology Image Segmentation (KPIs) Challenge, introducing a dataset that incorporates preclinical rodent models of CKD with over 10,000 annotated glomeruli from 60+ Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS)-stained whole slide images. The challenge includes two tasks, patch-level segmentation and whole slide image segmentation and detection, evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and F1-score. By encouraging innovative segmentation methods that adapt to diverse CKD models and tissue conditions, the KPIs Challenge aims to advance kidney pathology analysis, establish new benchmarks, and enable precise, large-scale quantification for disease research and diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a general and practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs.

| **[SparseFocus: Learning-based One-shot Autofocus for Microscopy with Sparse Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06452v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autofocus is necessary for high-throughput and real-time scanning in microscopic imaging. Traditional methods rely on complex hardware or iterative hill-climbing algorithms. Recent learning-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in a one-shot setting, avoiding hardware modifications or iterative mechanical lens adjustments. However, in this paper, we highlight a significant challenge that the richness of image content can significantly affect autofocus performance. When the image content is sparse, previous autofocus methods, whether traditional climbing-hill or learning-based, tend to fail. To tackle this, we propose a content-importance-based solution, named SparseFocus, featuring a novel two-stage pipeline. The first stage measures the importance of regions within the image, while the second stage calculates the defocus distance from selected important regions. To validate our approach and benefit the research community, we collect a large-scale dataset comprising millions of labelled defocused images, encompassing both dense, sparse and extremely sparse scenarios. Experimental results show that SparseFocus surpasses existing methods, effectively handling all levels of content sparsity. Moreover, we integrate SparseFocus into our Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) system that performs well in real-world applications. The code and dataset will be made available upon the publication of this paper.</p></details> |  |

Traditional cell segmentation approaches, while commonly used, are computationally expensive and require extensive post-processing, limiting their practicality for high-throughput clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from segmentation to detection for extracting cell information from WSIs, introducing CellNuc-DETR as a more effective solution. We evaluate the accuracy performance of CellNuc-DETR on the PanNuke dataset and conduct cross-dataset evaluations on CoNSeP and MoNuSeg to assess robustness and generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both cell nuclei detection and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of CellNuc-DETR on large WSIs, showing that it not only outperforms current methods in accuracy but also significantly reduces inference times. Specifically, CellNuc-DETR is twice as fast as the fastest segmentation-based method, HoVer-NeXt, while achieving substantially higher accuracy. Moreover, it surpasses CellViT in accuracy and is approximately ten times more efficient in inference speed on WSIs. These results establish CellNuc-DETR as a superior approach for cell analysis in digital pathology, combining high accuracy with computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Comprehensive datasets that combine histopathological images with genetic and survival data across various tumour sites are essential for advancing computational pathology and personalised medicine. $\textbf{Results}$: We present SurGen, a dataset comprising 1,020 H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from 843 colorectal cancer cases.

In this work, we present PathMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information on bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm, to probe and distil a classifier trained with bag-level information to obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the supervision for the same classifier in a finer way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose Two-Dimensional Positional Encoding (2DPE), which encodes the spatial appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. PathMIL is evaluated on multiple benchmarking tasks, including subtype classification (TCGA-NSCLC), tumour classification (CAMELYON16), and an internal benchmark for breast cancer receptor status classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with AUC scores of 0.9152 and 0.8524 for estrogen and progesterone receptor status classification, respectively, an AUC of 0.9618 for subtype classification, and 0.8634 for tumour classification, surpassing existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Cell Nuclei AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06381v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell nuclei instance segmentation is a crucial task in digital kidney pathology. Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Gap: Evaluating Patch Embeddings from General-Purpose and Histopathology Foundation Models for Cell Segmentation and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02471v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have transformed computer vision, driving significant performance improvements across diverse domains, including digital histopathology. However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Anything for Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00408v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nucleus segmentation is an important analysis task in digital pathology. However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/patho-sam.</p></details> |  |

Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a widely-used weakly supervised approach, bypasses the need for patch-level annotations. However, conventional MIL methods overlook the spatial relationships between patches, which are crucial for tasks such as cancer grading and diagnosis. To address this, graph-based approaches have gained prominence by incorporating spatial information through node connections. Despite their potential, both MIL and graph-based models are vulnerable to learning spurious associations, like color variations in WSIs, affecting their robustness. In this dissertation, we conduct an extensive comparison of multiple graph construction techniques, MIL models, graph-MIL approaches, and interventional training, introducing a new framework, Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning with Interventional Training (GMIL-IT), for WSI classification. We evaluate their impact on model generalization through domain shift analysis and demonstrate that graph-based models alone achieve the generalization initially anticipated from interventional training.

While transformer architectures excel at modeling long-range correlations through self-attention, their quadratic computational complexity makes them impractical for computational pathology applications. Existing solutions like local-global or linear self-attention reduce computational costs but compromise the strong modeling capabilities of full self-attention. In this work, we propose Querent, i.e., the query-aware long contextual dynamic modeling framework, which maintains the expressive power of full self-attention while achieving practical efficiency. Our method adaptively predicts which surrounding regions are most relevant for each patch, enabling focused yet unrestricted attention computation only with potentially important contexts. By using efficient region-wise metadata computation and importance estimation, our approach dramatically reduces computational overhead while preserving global perception to model fine-grained patch correlations. Through comprehensive experiments on biomarker prediction, gene mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and survival analysis across over 10 WSI datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Hypergraph Representation for Bone Metastasis Cancer Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16787v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bone metastasis analysis is a significant challenge in pathology and plays a critical role in determining patient quality of life and treatment strategies. The microenvironment and specific tissue structures are essential for pathologists to predict the primary bone cancer origins and primary bone cancer subtyping. By digitizing bone tissue sections into whole slide images (WSIs) and leveraging deep learning to model slide embeddings, this analysis can be enhanced. However, tumor metastasis involves complex multivariate interactions with diverse bone tissue structures, which traditional WSI analysis methods such as multiple instance learning (MIL) fail to capture. Moreover, graph neural networks (GNNs), limited to modeling pairwise relationships, are hard to represent high-order biological associations. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic hypergraph neural network (DyHG) that overcomes the edge construction limitations of traditional graph representations by connecting multiple nodes via hyperedges. A low-rank strategy is used to reduce the complexity of parameters in learning hypergraph structures, while a Gumbel-Softmax-based sampling strategy optimizes the patch distribution across hyperedges. An MIL aggregator is then used to derive a graph-level embedding for comprehensive WSI analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of DyHG, we construct two large-scale datasets for primary bone cancer origins and subtyping classification based on real-world bone metastasis scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyHG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, showcasing its ability to model complex biological interactions and improve the accuracy of bone metastasis analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages,11 figures |

Despite these advances, foundation models are still limited in their ability to encode the entire gigapixel whole-slide images without additional training and often lack complementary multimodal data. Here, we introduce Threads, a slide-level foundation model capable of generating universal representations of whole-slide images of any size. Threads was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse cohort of 47,171 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections, paired with corresponding genomic and transcriptomic profiles - the largest such paired dataset to be used for foundation model development to date. This unique training paradigm enables Threads to capture the tissue's underlying molecular composition, yielding powerful representations applicable to a wide array of downstream tasks. In extensive benchmarking across 54 oncology tasks, including clinical subtyping, grading, mutation prediction, immunohistochemistry status determination, treatment response prediction, and survival prediction, Threads outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and label efficiency. It is particularly well suited for predicting rare events, further emphasizing its clinical utility. We intend to make the model publicly available for the broader community.</p></details> |  |

Because z-stacking can offer enhanced depth information compared to the single-layer whole slide imaging, this technology can be particularly useful in analyzing small-scaled histopathological patterns. However, its actual clinical impact remains debated with mixed results. To clarify this, we investigate the effect of z-stack scanning on artificial intelligence (AI) mitosis detection of meningiomas. With the same set of 22 Hematoxylin and Eosin meningioma glass slides scanned by three different digital pathology scanners, we tested the performance of three AI pipelines on both single-layer and z-stacked whole slide images (WSIs). Results showed that in all scanner-AI combinations, z-stacked WSIs significantly increased AI's sensitivity (+17.14%) on the mitosis detection with only a marginal impact on precision. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that highlights z-stack scanning as a promising technique for AI mitosis detection, paving the way for more reliable AI-assisted pathology workflows, which can ultimately benefit patient management.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear 2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Self-Supervised Grading of Prostate Cancer Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15520v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prostate cancer grading using the ISUP system (International Society of Urological Pathology) for treatment decisions is highly subjective and requires considerable expertise. Despite advances in computer-aided diagnosis systems, few have handled efficient ISUP grading on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of prostate biopsies based only on slide-level labels. Some of the general challenges include managing gigapixel WSIs, obtaining patch-level annotations, and dealing with stain variability across centers. One of the main task-specific challenges faced by deep learning in ISUP grading, is the learning of patch-level features of Gleason patterns (GPs) based only on their slide labels. In this scenario, an efficient framework for ISUP grading is developed. The proposed TSOR is based on a novel Task-specific Self-supervised learning (SSL) model, which is fine-tuned using Ordinal Regression. Since the diversity of training samples plays a crucial role in SSL, a patch-level dataset is created to be relatively balanced w.r.t. the Gleason grades (GGs). This balanced dataset is used for pre-training, so that the model can effectively learn stain-agnostic features of the GP for better generalization. In medical image grading, it is desirable that misclassifications be as close as possible to the actual grade. From this perspective, the model is then fine-tuned for the task of ISUP grading using an ordinal regression-based approach. Experimental results on the most extensive multicenter prostate biopsies dataset (PANDA challenge), as well as the SICAP dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach of constructing guiding maps to improve the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models for BV segmentation, the guiding maps encourage the models to learn representative features of BVs. This is particularly beneficial for computational pathology, where labeled training data is often limited and large models are prone to overfitting. We have quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving segmentation accuracy. In future, we plan to validate this method to segment BVs across various tissue types and investigate the role of cellular structures in relation to BVs in the TME.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISBI 2025</p></details> |

Computational TIL assessment (CTA) has the potential to assist pathologists in this labour-intensive task, but current CTA models rely heavily on many detailed annotations. We propose and validate a fundamentally simpler deep learning based CTA that can be trained in only ten minutes on hundredfold fewer pathologist annotations. We collected whole slide images (WSIs) with TILs scores and clinical data of 2,340 patients with BC from six cohorts including three randomised clinical trials. Morphological features were extracted from whole slide images (WSIs) using a pathology foundation model. Our label-efficient Computational stromal TIL assessment model (ECTIL) directly regresses the TILs score from these features. ECTIL trained on only a few hundred samples (ECTIL-TCGA) showed concordance with the pathologist over five heterogeneous external cohorts (r=0.54-0.74, AUROC=0.80-0.94). Training on all slides of five cohorts (ECTIL-combined) improved results on a held-out test set (r=0.69, AUROC=0.85). Multivariable Cox regression analyses indicated that every 10% increase of ECTIL scores was associated with improved overall survival independent of clinicopathological variables (HR 0.86, p<0.01), similar to the pathologist score (HR 0.87, p<0.001). We demonstrate that ECTIL is highly concordant with an expert pathologist and obtains a similar hazard ratio.

| **[PreMix: Addressing Label Scarcity in Whole Slide Image Classification with Pre-trained Multiple Instance Learning Aggregators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01162v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as a powerful framework for weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling slide-level predictions without requiring detailed patch-level annotations. However, a key limitation of MIL lies in the underexplored potential of pre-training the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches train it from scratch, resulting in performance heavily dependent on the number of labeled WSIs, while overlooking the abundance of unlabeled WSIs available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating HIPT into PreMix achieves an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training datasets and label sizes. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

| **[Prior Knowledge Injection into Deep Learning Models Predicting Gene Expression from Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14056v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer diagnosis and prognosis primarily depend on clinical parameters such as age and tumor grade, and are increasingly complemented by molecular data, such as gene expression, from tumor sequencing. However, sequencing is costly and delays oncology workflows. Recent advances in Deep Learning allow to predict molecular information from morphological features within Whole Slide Images (WSIs), offering a cost-effective proxy of the molecular markers. While promising, current methods lack the robustness to fully replace direct sequencing. Here we aim to improve existing methods by introducing a model-agnostic framework that allows to inject prior knowledge on gene-gene interactions into Deep Learning architectures, thereby increasing accuracy and robustness. We design the framework to be generic and flexibly adaptable to a wide range of architectures. In a case study on breast cancer, our strategy leads to an average increase of 983 significant genes (out of 25,761) across all 18 experiments, with 14 generalizing to an increase on an independent dataset. Our findings reveal a high potential for injection of prior knowledge to increase gene expression prediction performance from WSIs across a wide range of architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Pre-Trained Feature Extractor Selection in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01167v4)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a preferred method for gigapixel whole slide image (WSI) classification without requiring patch-level annotations. Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset; 2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We hope that these insights can provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of the current SOTA pathology foundation models. Furthermore, this work may inform the development of more effective pathology foundation models.

| **[Scalable Whole Slide Image Representation Using K-Mean Clustering and Fisher Vector Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12085v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution, gigapixel sized images that pose significant computational challenges for traditional machine learning models due to their size and heterogeneity.In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient methodology for WSI classification by leveraging patch-based feature extraction, clustering, and Fisher vector encoding. Initially, WSIs are divided into fixed size patches, and deep feature embeddings are extracted from each patch using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). These patch-level embeddings are subsequently clustered using K-means clustering, where each cluster aggregates semantically similar regions of the WSI. To effectively summarize each cluster, Fisher vector representations are computed by modeling the distribution of patch embeddings in each cluster as a parametric Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The Fisher vectors from each cluster are concatenated into a high-dimensional feature vector, creating a compact and informative representation of the entire WSI. This feature vector is then used by a classifier to predict the WSI's diagnostic label. Our method captures local and global tissue structures and yields robust performance for large-scale WSI classification, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability compared to other approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Keep It Accurate and Robust: An Enhanced Nuclei Analysis Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03415v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation and classification of nuclei in histology images is critical but challenging due to nuclei heterogeneity, staining variations, and tissue complexity. Existing methods often struggle with limited dataset variability, with patches extracted from similar whole slide images (WSI), making models prone to falling into local optima. Here we propose a new framework to address this limitation and enable robust nuclear analysis. Our method leverages dual-level ensemble modeling to overcome issues stemming from limited dataset variation. Intra-ensembling applies diverse transformations to individual samples, while inter-ensembling combines networks of different scales. We also introduce enhancements to the HoVer-Net architecture, including updated encoders, nested dense decoding and model regularization strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks, including 1st place for nuclear composition prediction and 3rd place for segmentation/classification in the 2022 Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting (CoNIC) Challenge. This success validates our approach for accurate histological nuclei analysis. Extensive experiments and ablation studies provide insights into optimal network design choices and training techniques. In conclusion, this work proposes an improved framework advancing the state-of-the-art in nuclei analysis. We release our code and models (https://github.com/WinnieLaugh/CONIC_Pathology_AI) to serve as a toolkit for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask-guided cross-image attention for zero-shot in-silico histopathologic image generation with a diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11664v3)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating in-silico data with generative AI promises a cost-effective alternative to staining, imaging, and annotating whole slide images in computational pathology. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art solution for generating in-silico images, offering unparalleled fidelity and realism. Using appearance transfer diffusion models allows for zero-shot image generation, facilitating fast application and making model training unnecessary. However current appearance transfer diffusion models are designed for natural images, where the main task is to transfer the foreground object from an origin to a target domain, while the background is of insignificant importance. In computational pathology, specifically in oncology, it is however not straightforward to define which objects in an image should be classified as foreground and background, as all objects in an image may be of critical importance for the detailed understanding the tumor micro-environment. We contribute to the applicability of appearance transfer diffusion models to immunohistochemistry-stained images by modifying the appearance transfer guidance to alternate between class-specific AdaIN feature statistics matchings using existing segmentation masks. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the downstream task of supervised epithelium segmentation, showing that the number of manual annotations required for model training can be reduced by 75%, outperforming the baseline approach. Additionally, we consulted with a certified pathologist to investigate future improvements. We anticipate this work to inspire the application of zero-shot diffusion models in computational pathology, providing an efficient method to generate in-silico images with unmatched fidelity and realism, which prove meaningful for downstream tasks, such as training existing deep learning models or finetuning foundation models.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[CellOMaps: A Compact Representation for Robust Classification of Lung Adenocarcinoma Growth Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08094v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a morphologically heterogeneous disease, characterized by five primary histological growth patterns. The classification of such patterns is crucial due to their direct relation to prognosis but the high subjectivity and observer variability pose a major challenge. Although several studies have developed machine learning methods for growth pattern classification, they either only report the predominant pattern per slide or lack proper evaluation. We propose a generalizable machine learning pipeline capable of classifying lung tissue into one of the five patterns or as non-tumor. The proposed pipeline's strength lies in a novel compact Cell Organization Maps (cellOMaps) representation that captures the cellular spatial patterns from Hematoxylin and Eosin whole slide images (WSIs). The proposed pipeline provides state-of-the-art performance on LUAD growth pattern classification when evaluated on both internal unseen slides and external datasets, significantly outperforming the current approaches. In addition, our preliminary results show that the model's outputs can be used to predict patients Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quilt-LLaVA: Visual Instruction Tuning by Extracting Localized Narratives from Open-Source Histopathology Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04746v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosis in histopathology requires a global whole slide images (WSIs) analysis, requiring pathologists to compound evidence from different WSI patches. The gigapixel scale of WSIs poses a challenge for histopathology multi-modal models. Training multi-model models for histopathology requires instruction tuning datasets, which currently contain information for individual image patches, without a spatial grounding of the concepts within each patch and without a wider view of the WSI. Therefore, they lack sufficient diagnostic capacity for histopathology. To bridge this gap, we introduce Quilt-Instruct, a large-scale dataset of 107,131 histopathology-specific instruction question/answer pairs, grounded within diagnostically relevant image patches that make up the WSI. Our dataset is collected by leveraging educational histopathology videos from YouTube, which provides spatial localization of narrations by automatically extracting the narrators' cursor positions. Quilt-Instruct supports contextual reasoning by extracting diagnosis and supporting facts from the entire WSI. Using Quilt-Instruct, we train Quilt-LLaVA, which can reason beyond the given single image patch, enabling diagnostic reasoning across patches. To evaluate Quilt-LLaVA, we propose a comprehensive evaluation dataset created from 985 images and 1283 human-generated question-answers. We also thoroughly evaluate Quilt-LLaVA using public histopathology datasets, where Quilt-LLaVA significantly outperforms SOTA by over 10% on relative GPT-4 score and 4% and 9% on open and closed set VQA. Our code, data, and model are publicly accessible at quilt-llava.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[PySpatial: A High-Speed Whole Slide Image Pathomics Toolkit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06151v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis plays a crucial role in modern digital pathology, enabling large-scale feature extraction from tissue samples. However, traditional feature extraction pipelines based on tools like CellProfiler often involve lengthy workflows, requiring WSI segmentation into patches, feature extraction at the patch level, and subsequent mapping back to the original WSI. To address these challenges, we present PySpatial, a high-speed pathomics toolkit specifically designed for WSI-level analysis. PySpatial streamlines the conventional pipeline by directly operating on computational regions of interest, reducing redundant processing steps. Utilizing rtree-based spatial indexing and matrix-based computation, PySpatial efficiently maps and processes computational regions, significantly accelerating feature extraction while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments on two datasets-Perivascular Epithelioid Cell (PEC) and data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)-demonstrate substantial performance improvements. For smaller and sparse objects in PEC datasets, PySpatial achieves nearly a 10-fold speedup compared to standard CellProfiler pipelines. For larger objects, such as glomeruli and arteries in KPMP datasets, PySpatial achieves a 2-fold speedup. These results highlight PySpatial's potential to handle large-scale WSI analysis with enhanced efficiency and accuracy, paving the way for broader applications in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></details> |  |

However, the black-box nature of these models often limits their clinical adoption. We introduce GRAPHITE (Graph-based Interpretable Tissue Examination), a post-hoc explainable framework designed for breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. GRAPHITE employs a multiscale approach, extracting patches at various magnification levels, constructing an hierarchical graph, and utilising graph attention networks (GAT) with scalewise attention (SAN) to capture scale-dependent features. We trained the model on 140 tumour TMA cores and four benign whole slide images from which 140 benign samples were created, and tested it on 53 pathologist-annotated TMA samples. GRAPHITE outperformed traditional XAI methods, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.56, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, and a threshold robustness (ThR) of 0.70, indicating that the model maintains high performance across a wide range of thresholds. In clinical utility, GRAPHITE achieved the highest area under the decision curve (AUDC) of 4.17e+5, indicating reliable decision support across thresholds. These results highlight GRAPHITE's potential as a clinically valuable tool in computational pathology, providing interpretable visualisations that align with the pathologists' diagnostic reasoning and support precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Figures, 1 Tables</p></details> |

Interpretability is crucial for safely deploying such algorithms in high-stakes medical domains. Traditional MIL methods offer explanations by highlighting salient regions. However, such spatial heatmaps provide limited insights for end users. To address this, we propose a novel inherently interpretable WSI-classification approach that uses human-understandable pathology concepts to generate explanations. Our proposed Concept MIL model leverages recent advances in vision-language models to directly predict pathology concepts based on image features. The model's predictions are obtained through a linear combination of the concepts identified on the top-K patches of a WSI, enabling inherent explanations by tracing each concept's influence on the prediction. In contrast to traditional concept-based interpretable models, our approach eliminates the need for costly human annotations by leveraging the vision-language model. We validate our method on two widely used pathology datasets: Camelyon16 and PANDA. On both datasets, Concept MIL achieves AUC and accuracy scores over 0.9, putting it on par with state-of-the-art models. We further find that 87.1\% (Camelyon16) and 85.3\% (PANDA) of the top 20 patches fall within the tumor region. A user study shows that the concepts identified by our model align with the concepts used by pathologists, making it a promising strategy for human-interpretable WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often rely on limited data modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Cross-modal Fusion Network (ICFNet) that integrates histopathology whole slide images, genomic expression profiles, patient demographics, and treatment protocols. Specifically, three types of encoders, a residual orthogonal decomposition module and a unification fusion module are employed to merge multi-modal features to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, a balanced negative log-likelihood loss function is designed to ensure fair training across different patients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ICFNet outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on five public TCGA datasets, including BLCA, BRCA, GBMLGG, LUAD, and UCEC, and shows its potential to support clinical decision-making and advance precision medicine.

FDDM operates in two stages: patch-based classification, followed by region-based refinement, enabling cross-patch information intergation. Leveraging a newly curated dataset of osteosarcoma images, FDDM demonstrates superior segmentation performance, achieving up to a 10% improvement mIOU and a 32.12% enhancement in necrosis rate estimation over state-of-the-art methods.

RL2 leverages ResNet features with a normalizing flow to calculate RMSE distance in the latent space, providing reliable assessments across diverse histopathology datasets. We evaluated the performance of RL2 on degradation types, such as blur, Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and rectangular patches, as well as diffusion processes. RL2's monotonic response to increasing degradation makes it well-suited for models that assess image quality, proving a valuable advancement for evaluating image generation techniques in histopathology. It can also be used to discard low-quality patches while sampling from a whole slide image. It is also significantly lighter and faster compared to traditional metrics and requires fewer images to give stable metric value.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

Manual TIL quantification in whole slide images (WSIs) is laborious and subject to variability, potentially undermining patient outcomes. Our study introduces an automated pipeline that utilizes semi-stochastic patch sampling, patch classification to retain prognostically relevant patches, and cell quantification using the HoVer-Net model to streamline the TIL evaluation process. This pipeline efficiently excludes approximately 70% of areas not relevant for prognosis and requires only 5% of the remaining patches to maintain prognostic accuracy (c-index = 0.65). The computational efficiency achieved does not sacrifice prognostic accuracy, as demonstrated by the TILs score's strong association with patient survival, which outperforms traditional CD8 IHC scoring methods. While the pipeline demonstrates potential for enhancing NSCLC prognostication and personalization of treatment, comprehensive clinical validation is still required. Future research should focus on verifying its broader clinical utility and investigating additional biomarkers to improve NSCLC prognosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 7 appendix pages</p></details> |

Current digital pathology AI models lack systematic solutions to address trustworthiness concerns arising from model limitations and data discrepancies between model deployment and development environments. To address this issue, we developed TRUECAM, a framework designed to ensure both data and model trustworthiness in non-small cell lung cancer subtyping with whole-slide images. TRUECAM integrates 1) a spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process for identifying out-of-scope inputs and 2) an ambiguity-guided elimination of tiles to filter out highly ambiguous regions, addressing data trustworthiness, as well as 3) conformal prediction to ensure controlled error rates. We systematically evaluated the framework across multiple large-scale cancer datasets, leveraging both task-specific and foundation models, illustrate that an AI model wrapped with TRUECAM significantly outperforms models that lack such guidance, in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency, while also achieving improvements in fairness. These findings highlight TRUECAM as a versatile wrapper framework for digital pathology AI models with diverse architectural designs, promoting their responsible and effective applications in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning with Vision-Language Models for Incremental Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10573v3)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has very significant applications in clinical pathology, e.g., tumor identification and cancer diagnosis. Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches: one is for generating bag-level features by prototype-guided aggregation of instance features, while the other is for enhancing class features through a combination of class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four public WSI datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

However, most existing WSI datasets lack cell-level annotations, owing to the extremely high cost over giga-pixel images. Thus, it remains an open question whether deep learning models can directly and effectively analyze WSIs from the semantic aspect of cell distributions. In this work, we construct a large-scale WSI dataset with more than 5 billion cell-level annotations, termed WSI-Cell5B, and a novel hierarchical Cell Cloud Transformer (CCFormer) to tackle these challenges. WSI-Cell5B is based on 6,998 WSIs of 11 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program, and all WSIs are annotated per cell by coordinates and types. To the best of our knowledge, WSI-Cell5B is the first WSI-level large-scale dataset integrating cell-level annotations. On the other hand, CCFormer formulates the collection of cells in each WSI as a cell cloud and models cell spatial distribution. Specifically, Neighboring Information Embedding (NIE) is proposed to characterize the distribution of cells within the neighborhood of each cell, and a novel Hierarchical Spatial Perception (HSP) module is proposed to learn the spatial relationship among cells in a bottom-up manner. The clinical analysis indicates that WSI-Cell5B can be used to design clinical evaluation metrics based on counting cells that effectively assess the survival risk of patients. Extensive experiments on survival prediction and cancer staging show that learning from cell spatial distribution alone can already achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, i.e., CCFormer strongly outperforms other competing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the large size and complexity of WSIs may pose significant challenges for deep learning models, in both computational efficiency and effective representation learning. In this work, we introduce Pixel-Mamba, a novel deep learning architecture designed to efficiently handle gigapixel WSIs. Pixel-Mamba leverages the Mamba module, a state-space model (SSM) with linear memory complexity, and incorporates local inductive biases through progressively expanding tokens, akin to convolutional neural networks. This enables Pixel-Mamba to hierarchically combine both local and global information while efficiently addressing computational challenges. Remarkably, Pixel-Mamba achieves or even surpasses the quantitative performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models that were pretrained on millions of WSIs or WSI-text pairs, in a range of tumor staging and survival analysis tasks, {\bf even without requiring any pathology-specific pretraining}. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Pixel-Mamba as a powerful and efficient framework for end-to-end WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |

Under the paradigm of MIL, patch image representations are extracted and then fixed during the training of the MIL classifiers for efficiency consideration. However, the invariance of representations makes it difficult to perform data augmentation for WSI-level model training, which significantly limits the performance of the downstream WSI analysis. The current data augmentation methods for gigapixel images either introduce additional computational costs or result in a loss of semantic information, which is hard to meet the requirements for efficiency and stability needed for WSI model training. In this paper, we propose a Promptable Representation Distribution Learning framework (PRDL) for both patch-level representation learning and WSI-level data augmentation. Meanwhile, we explore the use of prompts to guide data augmentation in feature space, which achieves promptable data augmentation for training robust WSI-level models. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method stably outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

This analysis is a time demanding task, currently done by an expert pathologist that visually inspects the samples. Given the effort required to localise the pathogen in images, a limited number of annotations might be available in an initial setting. Our goal is to design an approach that, using a limited set of annotations, is capable of obtaining results good enough to be used as a support tool. Methods: We propose to use autoencoders to learn the latent patterns of healthy patches and formulate a specific measure of the reconstruction error of the image in HSV space. ROC analysis is used to set the optimal threshold of this measure and the percentage of positive patches in a sample that determines the presence of H. pylori. Results: Our method has been tested on an own database of 245 Whole Slide Images (WSI) having 117 cases without H. pylori and different density of the bacteria in the remaining ones. The database has 1211 annotated patches, with only 163 positive patches. This dataset of positive annotations was used to train a baseline thresholding and an SVM using the features of a pre-trained RedNet18 and ViT models. A 10-fold cross-validation shows that our method has better performance with 91% accuracy, 86% sensitivity, 96% specificity and 0.97 AUC in the diagnosis of H. pylori. Conclusion: Unlike classification approaches, our shallow autoencoder with threshold adaptation for the detection of anomalous staining is able to achieve competitive results with a limited set of annotated data. This initial approach is good enough to be used as a guide for fast annotation of infected patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advances in Kidney Biopsy Lesion Assessment through Dense Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17166v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renal biopsies are the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. Lesion scores made by renal pathologists are semi-quantitative and exhibit high inter-observer variability. Automating lesion classification within segmented anatomical structures can provide decision support in quantification analysis, thereby reducing inter-observer variability. Nevertheless, classifying lesions in regions-of-interest (ROIs) is clinically challenging due to (a) a large amount of densely packed anatomical objects, (b) class imbalance across different compartments (at least 3), (c) significant variation in size and shape of anatomical objects and (d) the presence of multi-label lesions per anatomical structure. Existing models cannot address these complexities in an efficient and generic manner. This paper presents an analysis for a \textbf{generalized solution} to datasets from various sources (pathology departments) with different types of lesions. Our approach utilizes two sub-networks: dense instance segmentation and lesion classification. We introduce \textbf{DiffRegFormer}, an end-to-end dense instance segmentation sub-network designed for multi-class, multi-scale objects within ROIs. Combining diffusion models, transformers, and RCNNs, DiffRegFormer {is a computational-friendly framework that can efficiently recognize over 500 objects across three anatomical classes, i.e., glomeruli, tubuli, and arteries, within ROIs.} In a dataset of 303 ROIs from 148 Jones' silver-stained renal Whole Slide Images (WSIs), our approach outperforms previous methods, achieving an Average Precision of 52.1\% (detection) and 46.8\% (segmentation). Moreover, our lesion classification sub-network achieves 89.2\% precision and 64.6\% recall on 21889 object patches out of the 303 ROIs. Lastly, our model demonstrates direct domain transfer to PAS-stained renal WSIs without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

While current digital pathology solutions rely on lossy JPEG compression to address this issue, lossy compression can introduce color and texture disparities, potentially impacting clinical decision-making. While prior research addresses perceptual image quality and downstream performance independently of each other, we jointly evaluate compression schemes for perceptual and downstream task quality on four different datasets. In addition, we collect an initially uncompressed dataset for an unbiased perceptual evaluation of compression schemes. Our results show that deep learning models fine-tuned for perceptual quality outperform conventional compression schemes like JPEG-XL or WebP for further compression of WSI. However, they exhibit a significant bias towards the compression artifacts present in the training data and struggle to generalize across various compression schemes. We introduce a novel evaluation metric based on feature similarity between original files and compressed files that aligns very well with the actual downstream performance on the compressed WSI. Our metric allows for a general and standardized evaluation of lossy compression schemes and mitigates the requirement to independently assess different downstream tasks. Our study provides novel insights for the assessment of lossy compression schemes for WSI and encourages a unified evaluation of lossy compression schemes to accelerate the clinical uptake of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Knowledge-enhanced Pathology Vision-language Foundation Model for Cancer Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13126v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has enabled the development of highly robust foundation models for various pathological tasks across diverse diseases and patient cohorts. Among these models, vision-language pre-training, which leverages large-scale paired data to align pathology image and text embedding spaces, and provides a novel zero-shot paradigm for downstream tasks. However, existing models have been primarily data-driven and lack the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, which limits their performance in cancer diagnosis, especially for rare tumor subtypes. To address this limitation, we establish a Knowledge-enhanced Pathology (KEEP) foundation model that harnesses disease knowledge to facilitate vision-language pre-training. Specifically, we first construct a disease knowledge graph (KG) that covers 11,454 human diseases with 139,143 disease attributes, including synonyms, definitions, and hypernym relations. We then systematically reorganize the millions of publicly available noisy pathology image-text pairs, into 143K well-structured semantic groups linked through the hierarchical relations of the disease KG. To derive more nuanced image and text representations, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced vision-language pre-training approach that integrates disease knowledge into the alignment within hierarchical semantic groups instead of unstructured image-text pairs. Validated on 18 diverse benchmarks with more than 14,000 whole slide images (WSIs), KEEP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot cancer diagnostic tasks. Notably, for cancer detection, KEEP demonstrates an average sensitivity of 89.8% at a specificity of 95.0% across 7 cancer types. For cancer subtyping, KEEP achieves a median balanced accuracy of 0.456 in subtyping 30 rare brain cancers, indicating strong generalizability for diagnosing rare tumors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Embedding Aggregation Methods in Computational Pathology: A Clinical Data Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07841v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular self-supervised learning of foundation models (FMs), are revolutionizing medical imaging and computational pathology (CPath). A constant challenge in the analysis of digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is the problem of aggregating tens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings to a slide-level representation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for genomic research, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of these techniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequately explored. This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of ten slide-level aggregation techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks, including diagnostic assessment, biomarker classification, and outcome prediction. The results yield following key insights: (1) Embeddings derived from domain-specific (histological images) FMs outperform those from generic ImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware aggregators enhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained models but not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks and spatially-aware models do not show general superiority as it would be expected. These findings underscore the need for more adaptable and universally applicable aggregation techniques, guiding future research towards tools that better meet the evolving needs of clinical-AI in pathology.

Previous research has primarily focused on separately training patch-level and whole-slide image (WSI)-level models, limiting the integration of learned knowledge across patches and WSIs, and resulting in redundant models. In this work, we introduce CPath-Omni, the first 15-billion-parameter LMM designed to unify both patch and WSI level image analysis, consolidating a variety of tasks at both levels, including classification, visual question answering, captioning, and visual referring prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPath-Omni achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across seven diverse tasks on 39 out of 42 datasets, outperforming or matching task-specific models trained for individual tasks. Additionally, we develop a specialized pathology CLIP-based visual processor for CPath-Omni, CPath-CLIP, which, for the first time, integrates different vision models and incorporates a large language model as a text encoder to build a more powerful CLIP model, which achieves SOTA performance on nine zero-shot and four few-shot datasets. Our findings highlight CPath-Omni's ability to unify diverse pathology tasks, demonstrating its potential to streamline and advance the field of foundation model in pathology.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

However, the invariance of these representations to patch rotation remains unexplored. This study investigates the rotational invariance of latent representations across twelve foundation models by quantifying the alignment between non-rotated and rotated patches using mutual $k$-nearest neighbours and cosine distance. Models that incorporated rotation augmentation during self-supervised training exhibited significantly greater invariance to rotations. We hypothesise that the absence of rotational inductive bias in the transformer architecture necessitates rotation augmentation during training to achieve learned invariance.

This approach leads to slide representations highly tailored to a specific clinical task. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.5% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors. Code available at https://github.com/KatherLab/COBRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[HMIL: Hierarchical Multi-Instance Learning for Fine-Grained Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07660v2)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained classification of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential in precision oncology, enabling precise cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. The core of this task involves distinguishing subtle morphological variations within the same broad category of gigapixel-resolution images, which presents a significant challenge. While the multi-instance learning (MIL) paradigm alleviates the computational burden of WSIs, existing MIL methods often overlook hierarchical label correlations, treating fine-grained classification as a flat multi-class classification task. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel hierarchical multi-instance learning (HMIL) framework. By facilitating on the hierarchical alignment of inherent relationships between different hierarchy of labels at instance and bag level, our approach provides a more structured and informative learning process. Specifically, HMIL incorporates a class-wise attention mechanism that aligns hierarchical information at both the instance and bag levels. Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability for fine-grained classification and a curriculum-based dynamic weighting module to adaptively balance the hierarchical feature during training. Extensive experiments on our large-scale cytology cervical cancer (CCC) dataset and two public histology datasets, BRACS and PANDA, demonstrate the state-of-the-art class-wise and overall performance of our HMIL framework.

However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block Dual Fusion of Whole Slide Images and Omics Data for Precision Oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17418v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of DNA methylation data with a Whole Slide Image (WSI) offers significant potential for enhancing the diagnostic precision of central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification in neuropathology. While existing approaches typically integrate encoded omic data with histology at either an early or late fusion stage, the potential of reintroducing omic data through dual fusion remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose the use of omic embeddings during early and late fusion to capture complementary information from local (patch-level) to global (slide-level) interactions, boosting performance through multimodal integration. In the early fusion stage, omic embeddings are projected onto WSI patches in latent-space, which generates embeddings that encapsulate per-patch molecular and morphological insights. This effectively incorporates omic information into the spatial representation of the WSI. These embeddings are then refined with a Multiple Instance Learning gated attention mechanism which attends to diagnostic patches. In the late fusion stage, we reintroduce the omic data by fusing it with slide-level omic-WSI embeddings using a Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB), which richly intermingles features from both modalities, capturing their correlations and complementarity. We demonstrate accurate CNS tumor subtyping across 20 fine-grained subtypes and validate our approach on benchmark datasets, achieving improved survival prediction on TCGA-BLCA and competitive performance on TCGA-BRCA compared to state-of-the-art methods. This dual fusion strategy enhances interpretability and classification performance, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised to 10 pages, with corrected typos, updated references (some added, others removed), improved figure quality, modified text for better method validation, added one more co-author, and identified the IEEE member</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 35 tables</p></details> |

We developed a multi-modal ensemble model (MMEM) that integrates pretreatment clinical data, multi-omics data, and histopathology whole slide image (WSI) data to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for ccRCC patients. Methods: We analyzed 226 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC) dataset, which includes OS, DFS follow-up data, and five data modalities: clinical data, WSIs, and three multi-omics datasets (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation). Separate survival models were built for OS and DFS. Cox-proportional hazards (CPH) model with forward feature selection is used for clinical and multi-omics data. Features from WSIs were extracted using ResNet and three general-purpose foundation models. A deep learning-based CPH model predicted survival using encoded WSI features. Risk scores from all models were combined based on training performance. Results: Performance was assessed using concordance index (C-index) and AUROC. The clinical feature-based CPH model received the highest weight for both OS and DFS tasks. Among WSI-based models, the general-purpose foundation model (UNI) achieved the best performance. The final MMEM model surpassed single-modality models, achieving C-indices of 0.820 (OS) and 0.833 (DFS), and AUROC values of 0.831 (3-year patient death) and 0.862 (cancer recurrence). Using predicted risk medians to stratify high- and low-risk groups, log-rank tests showed improved performance in both OS and DFS compared to single-modality models. Conclusion: MMEM is the first multi-modal model for ccRCC patients, integrating five data modalities. It outperformed single-modality models in prognostic ability and has the potential to assist in ccRCC patient management if independently validated.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[GCUNet: A GNN-Based Contextual Learning Network for Tertiary Lymphoid Structure Semantic Segmentation in Whole Slide Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06129v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) semantic segmentation in whole slide image (WSI). Unlike TLS binary segmentation, TLS semantic segmentation identifies boundaries and maturity, which requires integrating contextual information to discover discriminative features. Due to the extensive scale of WSI (e.g., 100,000 \times 100,000 pixels), the segmentation of TLS is usually carried out through a patch-based strategy. However, this prevents the model from accessing information outside of the patches, limiting the performance. To address this issue, we propose GCUNet, a GNN-based contextual learning network for TLS semantic segmentation. Given an image patch (target) to be segmented, GCUNet first progressively aggregates long-range and fine-grained context outside the target. Then, a Detail and Context Fusion block (DCFusion) is designed to integrate the context and detail of the target to predict the segmentation mask. We build four TLS semantic segmentation datasets, called TCGA-COAD, TCGA-LUSC, TCGA-BLCA and INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former three datasets (comprising 826 WSIs and 15,276 TLSs) publicly available to promote the TLS semantic segmentation. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCUNet, achieving at least 7.41% improvement in mF1 compared with SOTA.</p></details> |  |

Currently, however, most deep learning-based ST analyses are limited to two-dimensional (2D) sections, which can introduce diagnostic errors due to the heterogeneity of pathological tissues across 3D sections. Expanding ST to three-dimensional (3D) volumes is challenging due to the prohibitive costs; a 2D ST acquisition already costs over 50 times more than whole slide imaging (WSI), and a full 3D volume with 10 sections can be an order of magnitude more expensive. To reduce costs, scientists have attempted to predict ST data directly from WSI without performing actual ST acquisition. However, these methods typically yield unsatisfying results. To address this, we introduce a novel problem setting: 3D ST imputation using 3D WSI histology sections combined with a single 2D ST slide. To do so, we present the Anatomy-aware Spatial Imputation Graph Network (ASIGN) for more precise, yet affordable, 3D ST modeling. The ASIGN architecture extends existing 2D spatial relationships into 3D by leveraging cross-layer overlap and similarity-based expansion. Moreover, a multi-level spatial attention graph network integrates features comprehensively across different data sources. We evaluated ASIGN on three public spatial transcriptomics datasets, with experimental results demonstrating that ASIGN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D scenarios.

Nevertheless, existing methods have not fully utilized the inherent hierarchical structure within both whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic data, from which better intra-modal representations and inter-modal integration could be derived. Moreover, many existing studies attempt to improve multi-modal representations through attention mechanisms, which inevitably lead to high complexity when processing high-dimensional WSIs and transcriptomic data. Recently, a structured state space model named Mamba emerged as a promising approach for its superior performance in modeling long sequences with low complexity. In this study, we propose Mamba with multi-grained multi-modal interaction (SurvMamba) for survival prediction. SurvMamba is implemented with a Hierarchical Interaction Mamba (HIM) module that facilitates efficient intra-modal interactions at different granularities, thereby capturing more detailed local features as well as rich global representations. In addition, an Interaction Fusion Mamba (IFM) module is used for cascaded inter-modal interactive fusion, yielding more comprehensive features for survival prediction. Comprehensive evaluations on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that SurvMamba outperforms other existing methods in terms of performance and computational cost.</p></details> |  |

This opens up new possibilities for enhancing whole slide image (WSI) prediction tasks with localized gene expression.

To address this, we introduce MERGE (Multi-faceted hiErarchical gRaph for Gene Expressions), which combines a multi-faceted hierarchical graph construction strategy with graph neural networks (GNN) to improve gene expression predictions from WSIs. By clustering tissue image patches based on both spatial and morphological features, and incorporating intra- and inter-cluster edges, our approach fosters interactions between distant tissue locations during GNN learning. As an additional contribution, we evaluate different data smoothing techniques that are necessary to mitigate artifacts in ST data, often caused by technical imperfections. We advocate for adopting gene-aware smoothing methods that are more biologically justified. Experimental results on gene expression prediction show that our GNN method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper: 8 pages, Supplementary Material: 9 pages, Figures: 16</p></details> |

Since differentiation of cancer sub-types is important for treatment and current, manual methods are time consuming and subjective, automatic computer-aided differentiation of cancer types is crucial. Manual differentiation of thyroid cancer is based on tissue sections, analysed by pathologists using histological features. Due to the enormous size of gigapixel whole slide images, holistic classification using deep learning methods is not feasible. Patch based multiple instance learning approaches, combined with aggregations such as bag-of-words, is a common approach. This work's contribution is to extend a patch based state-of-the-art method by generating and combining feature vectors of three different patch resolutions and analysing three distinct ways of combining them.

Transformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to their quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently, Mamba introduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high parallelism, enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D sequences. However, extending Mamba to vision tasks, which inherently involve 2D structures, results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D sequence processing. On the other hand, current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D structures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack of efficient parallel algorithms. In this work, we propose 2DMamba, a novel 2D selective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images into Mamba, with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator, adopting both spatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of our approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that 2DMamba~improves up to $2.48\%$ in AUC, $3.11\%$ in F1 score, $2.47\%$ in accuracy and $5.52\%$ in C-index. Additionally, integrating our method with VMamba for natural imaging yields $0.5$ to $0.7$ improvements in mIoU on the ADE20k semantic segmentation dataset, and $0.2\%$ accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K classification dataset.

However, current approaches predominantly rely on visual-language models, which may impose limitations from a molecular perspective and lead to performance bottlenecks. Here, we introduce a Unified Molecule-enhanced Pathology Image REpresentationn Learning framework (UMPIRE). UMPIRE aims to leverage complementary information from gene expression profiles to guide the multimodal pre-training, enhancing the molecular awareness of pathology image representation learning. We demonstrate that this molecular perspective provides a robust, task-agnostic training signal for learning pathology image embeddings. Due to the scarcity of paired data, approximately 4 million entries of spatial transcriptomics gene expression were collected to train the gene encoder. By leveraging powerful pre-trained encoders, UMPIRE aligns the encoders across over 697K pathology image-gene expression pairs. The performance of UMPIRE is demonstrated across various molecular-related downstream tasks, including gene expression prediction, spot classification, and mutation state prediction in whole slide images. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and open new avenues for exploring computational pathology enhanced by molecular perspectives.

In this study, we focus on our experience at University of Texas Health-McGovern Medical School in Houston, Texas in providing hematopathology consultation to the Pathology Department at Ho Chi Minh City Oncology Hospital in Vietnam. Over a 32-month period, 71 hematopathology cases were submitted for telepathology. Diagnostic efficiency significantly improved with average turnaround times reduced by 30% compared to traditional on-site consultations with local pathologists using glass slides. A web site has been established in this telepathology project to retain information of the most recently discussed cases for further review after the teleconference. Telepathology provides an effective platform for real-time consultations, allowing remote subspecialty experts to interact with local pathologists for comprehensive case reviews. This process also fosters ongoing education, facilitating knowledge transfer in regions where specialized hematopathology expertise is limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 Tables, 8 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Weighted Circle Fusion: Ensembling Circle Representation from Different Object Detection Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19540v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the use of circle representation has emerged as a method to improve the identification of spherical objects (such as glomeruli, cells, and nuclei) in medical imaging studies. In traditional bounding box-based object detection, combining results from multiple models improves accuracy, especially when real-time processing isn't crucial. Unfortunately, this widely adopted strategy is not readily available for combining circle representations. In this paper, we propose Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), a simple approach for merging predictions from various circle detection models. Our method leverages confidence scores associated with each proposed bounding circle to generate averaged circles. We evaluate our method on a proprietary dataset for glomerular detection in whole slide imaging (WSI) and find a performance gain of 5% compared to existing ensemble methods. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of two annotation methods, fully manual annotation and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach, in labeling 200,000 glomeruli. The HITL approach, which integrates machine learning detection with human verification, demonstrated remarkable improvements in annotation efficiency. The Weighted Circle Fusion technique not only enhances object detection precision but also notably reduces false detections, presenting a promising direction for future research and application in pathological image analysis.

However, existing open-source tools are often distributed as source code or Docker containers, requiring advanced programming skills that hinder accessibility for non-programmers, such as clinicians. Additionally, current models are typically trained on a single dataset and lack flexibility in adjusting confidence levels for predictions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GloFinder, a QuPath plugin designed for single-click automated glomeruli detection across entire WSIs with online editing through the graphical user interface (GUI). GloFinder employs CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework utilizing circle representations for precise object localization, with models trained on approximately 160,000 manually annotated glomeruli. To further enhance accuracy, the plugin incorporates Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), an ensemble method that combines confidence scores from multiple CircleNet models to produce refined predictions, achieving superior performance in glomerular detection. GloFinder enables direct visualization and editing of results in QuPath, facilitating seamless interaction for clinicians and providing a powerful tool for nephropathology research and clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeneQuery: A General QA-based Framework for Spatial Gene Expression Predictions from Histology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18391v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gene expression profiling provides profound insights into molecular mechanisms, but its time-consuming and costly nature often presents significant challenges. In contrast, whole-slide hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histological images are readily accessible and allow for detailed examinations of tissue structure and composition at the microscopic level. Recent advancements have utilized these histological images to predict spatially resolved gene expression profiles. However, state-of-the-art works treat gene expression prediction as a multi-output regression problem, where each gene is learned independently with its own weights, failing to capture the shared dependencies and co-expression patterns between genes. Besides, existing works can only predict gene expression values for genes seen during training, limiting their ability to generalize to new, unseen genes. To address the above limitations, this paper presents GeneQuery, which aims to solve this gene expression prediction task in a question-answering (QA) manner for better generality and flexibility. Specifically, GeneQuery takes gene-related texts as queries and whole-slide images as contexts and then predicts the queried gene expression values. With such a transformation, GeneQuery can implicitly estimate the gene distribution by introducing the gene random variable. Besides, the proposed GeneQuery consists of two architecture implementations, i.e., spot-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between images and gene-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between genes. Comprehensive experiments on spatial transcriptomics datasets show that the proposed GeneQuery outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on known and unseen genes. More results also demonstrate that GeneQuery can potentially analyze the tissue structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[PATHS: A Hierarchical Transformer for Efficient Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18225v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational analysis of whole slide images (WSIs) has seen significant research progress in recent years, with applications ranging across important diagnostic and prognostic tasks such as survival or cancer subtype prediction. Many state-of-the-art models process the entire slide - which may be as large as $150,000 \times 150,000$ pixels - as a bag of many patches, the size of which necessitates computationally cheap feature aggregation methods. However, a large proportion of these patches are uninformative, such as those containing only healthy or adipose tissue, adding significant noise and size to the bag. We propose Pathology Transformer with Hierarchical Selection (PATHS), a novel top-down method for hierarchical weakly supervised representation learning on slide-level tasks in computational pathology. PATHS is inspired by the cross-magnification manner in which a human pathologist examines a slide, recursively filtering patches at each magnification level to a small subset relevant to the diagnosis. Our method overcomes the complications of processing the entire slide, enabling quadratic self-attention and providing a simple interpretable measure of region importance. We apply PATHS to five datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and achieve superior performance on slide-level prediction tasks when compared to previous methods, despite processing only a small proportion of the slide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Knowledge Concepts to Whole Slide Images for Precise Histopathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18101v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the large size and lack of fine-grained annotation, Whole Slide Images (WSIs) analysis is commonly approached as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, previous studies only learn from training data, posing a stark contrast to how human clinicians teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities and factors. Here we present a novel knowledge concept-based MIL framework, named ConcepPath to fill this gap. Specifically, ConcepPath utilizes GPT-4 to induce reliable diseasespecific human expert concepts from medical literature, and incorporate them with a group of purely learnable concepts to extract complementary knowledge from training data. In ConcepPath, WSIs are aligned to these linguistic knowledge concepts by utilizing pathology vision-language model as the basic building component. In the application of lung cancer subtyping, breast cancer HER2 scoring, and gastric cancer immunotherapy-sensitive subtyping task, ConcepPath significantly outperformed previous SOTA methods which lack the guidance of human expert knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Our study shows that using fixed hyper-parameters for pre-processing out-of-domain WSIs can significantly degrade performance. Therefore, it is critical to search domain-specific hyper-parameters during inference. However, searching for an optimal parameter set is time-consuming. To overcome this, we propose BAHOP, a novel Similarity-based Basin Hopping optimization for fast parameter tuning to enhance inference performance on out-of-domain data. The proposed BAHOP achieves 5\% to 30\% improvement in accuracy with $\times5$ times faster on average.</p></details> |  |

Our group previously developed the Glo-In-One toolkit for integrated detection and segmentation of glomeruli. In this study, we leverage the Glo-In-One toolkit to version 2 with fine-grained segmentation capabilities, curating 14 distinct labels for tissue regions, cells, and lesions across a dataset of 23,529 annotated glomeruli across human and mouse histopathology data. To our knowledge, this dataset is among the largest of its kind to date.In this study, we present a single dynamic head deep learning architecture designed to segment 14 classes within partially labeled images of human and mouse pathology data. Our model was trained using a training set derived from 368 annotated kidney whole-slide images (WSIs) to identify 5 key intraglomerular tissues covering Bowman's capsule, glomerular tuft, mesangium, mesangial cells, and podocytes. Additionally, the network segments 9 glomerular lesion classes including adhesion, capsular drop, global sclerosis, hyalinosis, mesangial lysis, microaneurysm, nodular sclerosis, mesangial expansion, and segmental sclerosis. The glomerulus segmentation model achieved a decent performance compared with baselines, and achieved a 76.5 % average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Additional, transfer learning from rodent to human for glomerular lesion segmentation model has enhanced the average segmentation accuracy across different types of lesions by more than 3 %, as measured by Dice scores. The Glo-In-One-v2 model and trained weight have been made publicly available at https: //github.com/hrlblab/Glo-In-One_v2.</p></details> |  |

Eosinophils (Eos), a crucial component in the mucosal immune response, have been linked to disease severity in CRS. The diagnosis of eosinophilic CRS typically uses a threshold of 10-20 eos per high-power field (HPF). However, manually counting Eos in histological samples is laborious and time-intensive, making the use of AI-driven methods for automated evaluations highly desirable. Interestingly, eosinophils are predominantly located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which has prompted the release of numerous deep learning models trained on GI data. This study leverages a CircleSnake model initially trained on upper-GI data to segment Eos cells in whole slide images (WSIs) of nasal tissues. It aims to determine the extent to which Eos segmentation models developed for the GI tract can be adapted to nasal applications without retraining. The experimental results show promising accuracy in some WSIs, although, unsurprisingly, the performance varies across cases. This paper details these performance outcomes, delves into the reasons for such variations, and aims to provide insights that could guide future development of deep learning models for eosinophilic CRS.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[FOCUS: Knowledge-enhanced Adaptive Visual Compression for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14743v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot learning presents a critical solution for cancer diagnosis in computational pathology (CPath), addressing fundamental limitations in data availability, particularly the scarcity of expert annotations and patient privacy constraints. A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dddavid4real/FOCUS.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Stain-Invariant Representation for Tissue Classification in Histology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15237v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of digitising histology slides involves multiple factors that can affect a whole slide image's (WSI) final appearance, including the staining protocol, scanner, and tissue type. This variability constitutes a domain shift and results in significant problems when training and testing deep learning (DL) algorithms in multi-cohort settings. As such, developing robust and generalisable DL models in computational pathology (CPath) remains an open challenge. In this regard, we propose a framework that generates stain-augmented versions of the training images using stain matrix perturbation. Thereafter, we employed a stain regularisation loss to enforce consistency between the feature representations of the source and augmented images. Doing so encourages the model to learn stain-invariant and, consequently, domain-invariant feature representations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on cross-domain multi-class tissue type classification of colorectal cancer images and have achieved improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Attention Model with Reinforcement Learning for Classification of Histology Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09682v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital whole slide images (WSIs) are generally captured at microscopic resolution and encompass extensive spatial data. Directly feeding these images to deep learning models is computationally intractable due to memory constraints, while downsampling the WSIs risks incurring information loss. Alternatively, splitting the WSIs into smaller patches may result in a loss of important contextual information. In this paper, we propose a novel dual attention approach, consisting of two main components, both inspired by the visual examination process of a pathologist: The first soft attention model processes a low magnification view of the WSI to identify relevant regions of interest, followed by a custom sampling method to extract diverse and spatially distinct image tiles from the selected ROIs. The second component, the hard attention classification model further extracts a sequence of multi-resolution glimpses from each tile for classification. Since hard attention is non-differentiable, we train this component using reinforcement learning to predict the location of the glimpses. This approach allows the model to focus on essential regions instead of processing the entire tile, thereby aligning with a pathologist's way of diagnosis. The two components are trained in an end-to-end fashion using a joint loss function to demonstrate the efficacy of the model. The proposed model was evaluated on two WSI-level classification problems: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 scoring on breast cancer histology images and prediction of Intact/Loss status of two Mismatch Repair biomarkers from colorectal cancer histology images. We show that the proposed model achieves performance better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods while processing less than 10% of the WSI at the highest magnification and reducing the time required to infer the WSI-level label by more than 75%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Domain Adaptation with Dual-branch Encoder and Two-level Alignment for Whole Slide Image-based Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14001v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, histopathological whole slide image (WSI)- based survival analysis has attracted much attention in medical image analysis. In practice, WSIs usually come from different hospitals or laboratories, which can be seen as different domains, and thus may have significant differences in imaging equipment, processing procedures, and sample sources. These differences generally result in large gaps in distribution between different WSI domains, and thus the survival analysis models trained on one domain may fail to transfer to another. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-branch Encoder and Two-level Alignment (DETA) framework to explore both feature and category-level alignment between different WSI domains. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as graph domain adaptation (GDA) by virtue the graph representation of WSIs. Then we construct a dual-branch graph encoder, including the message passing branch and the shortest path branch, to explicitly and implicitly extract semantic information from the graph-represented WSIs. To realize GDA, we propose a two-level alignment approach: at the category level, we develop a coupling technique by virtue of the dual-branch structure, leading to reduced divergence between the category distributions of the two domains; at the feature level, we introduce an adversarial perturbation strategy to better augment source domain feature, resulting in improved alignment in feature distribution. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to alleviate the domain shift issue for WSI data analysis. Extensive experiments on four TCGA datasets have validated the effectiveness of our proposed DETA framework and demonstrated its superior performance in WSI-based survival analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[NACNet: A Histology Context-aware Transformer Graph Convolution Network for Predicting Treatment Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09766v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (Nov 07 2024)</p></details> |

Although computer-aided diagnostic systems have shown considerable value in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, the problem of multi-classification under sample imbalance remains an intractable challenge. To address this, we propose learning fine-grained information by generating sub-bags with feature distributions similar to the original WSIs. Additionally, we utilize a pseudo-bag generation algorithm to further leverage the abundant and redundant information in WSIs, allowing efficient training in unbalanced-sample multi-classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an affinity-based sample selection and curriculum contrastive learning strategy to enhance the stability of model representation learning. Unlike previous approaches, our framework transitions from learning bag-level representations to understanding and exploiting the feature distribution of multi-instance bags. Our method demonstrates significant performance improvements on three datasets, including tumor classification and lymph node metastasis. On average, it achieves a 4.39-point improvement in F1 score compared to the second-best method across the three tasks, underscoring its superior performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Towards a Comprehensive Benchmark for Pathological Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer Sections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10752v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in optical microscopy scanning have significantly contributed to computational pathology (CPath) by converting traditional histopathological slides into whole slide images (WSIs). This development enables comprehensive digital reviews by pathologists and accelerates AI-driven diagnostic support for WSI analysis. Recent advances in foundational pathology models have increased the need for benchmarking tasks. The Camelyon series is one of the most widely used open-source datasets in computational pathology. However, the quality, accessibility, and clinical relevance of the labels have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs and labels from the Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17 datasets, removing low-quality slides, correcting erroneous labels, and providing expert pixel annotations for tumor regions in the previously unreleased test set. Based on the sizes of re-annotated tumor regions, we upgraded the binary cancer screening task to a four-class task: negative, micro-metastasis, macro-metastasis, and Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC). We reevaluated pre-trained pathology feature extractors and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods using the cleaned dataset, providing a benchmark that advances AI development in histopathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnostic Text-guided Representation Learning in Hierarchical Classification for Pathological Whole Slide Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10709v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of digital imaging in medical microscopy, artificial intelligent-based analysis of pathological whole slide images (WSIs) provides a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis. Limited by the expensive cost of pixel-level annotation, current research primarily focuses on representation learning with slide-level labels, showing success in various downstream tasks. However, given the diversity of lesion types and the complex relationships between each other, these techniques still deserve further exploration in addressing advanced pathology tasks. To this end, we introduce the concept of hierarchical pathological image classification and propose a representation learning called PathTree. PathTree considers the multi-classification of diseases as a binary tree structure. Each category is represented as a professional pathological text description, which messages information with a tree-like encoder. The interactive text features are then used to guide the aggregation of hierarchical multiple representations. PathTree uses slide-text similarity to obtain probability scores and introduces two extra tree specific losses to further constrain the association between texts and slides. Through extensive experiments on three challenging hierarchical classification datasets: in-house cryosectioned lung tissue lesion identification, public prostate cancer grade assessment, and public breast cancer subtyping, our proposed PathTree is consistently competitive compared to the state-of-the-art methods and provides a new perspective on the deep learning-assisted solution for more complex WSI classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

Foundation models have the potential to improve generalizability within and across centers and serve as starting points for data efficient development of specialized yet robust AI models. However, the training foundation models themselves is usually very expensive in terms of data, computation, and time. This paper proposes a supervised training method that drastically reduces these expenses. The proposed method is based on multi-task learning to train a joint encoder, by combining 16 different classification, segmentation, and detection tasks on a total of 912,000 patches. Since the encoder is capable of capturing the properties of the samples, we term it the Tissue Concepts encoder. To evaluate the performance and generalizability of the Tissue Concepts encoder across centers, classification of whole slide images from four of the most prevalent solid cancers - breast, colon, lung, and prostate - was used. The experiments show that the Tissue Concepts model achieve comparable performance to models trained with self-supervision, while requiring only 6% of the amount of training patches. Furthermore, the Tissue Concepts encoder outperforms an ImageNet pre-trained encoder on both in-domain and out-of-domain data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 Pa...</summary><p>22 Pages, 3 Figures, submitted to and under revision at Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

| **[Free Lunch in Pathology Foundation Model: Task-specific Model Adaptation with Concept-Guided Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09894v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis is gaining prominence within the medical imaging field. Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE. The source code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CATE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Fetal Inflammatory Response Diagnosis in the Umbilical Cord](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09767v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inflammation of the umbilical cord can be seen as a result of ascending intrauterine infection or other inflammatory stimuli. Acute fetal inflammatory response (FIR) is characterized by infiltration of the umbilical cord by fetal neutrophils, and can be associated with neonatal sepsis or fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Recent advances in deep learning in digital pathology have demonstrated favorable performance across a wide range of clinical tasks, such as diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we classified FIR from whole slide images (WSI). We digitized 4100 histological slides of umbilical cord stained with hematoxylin and eosin(H&E) and extracted placental diagnoses from the electronic health record. We build models using attention-based whole slide learning models. We compared strategies between features extracted by a model (ConvNeXtXLarge) pretrained on non-medical images (ImageNet), and one pretrained using histopathology images (UNI). We trained multiple iterations of each model and combined them into an ensemble. The predictions from the ensemble of models trained using UNI achieved an overall balanced accuracy of 0.836 on the test dataset. In comparison, the ensembled predictions using ConvNeXtXLarge had a lower balanced accuracy of 0.7209. Heatmaps generated from top accuracy model appropriately highlighted arteritis in cases of FIR 2. In FIR 1, the highest performing model assigned high attention to areas of activated-appearing stroma in Wharton's Jelly. However, other high-performing models assigned attention to umbilical vessels. We developed models for diagnosis of FIR from placental histology images, helping reduce interobserver variability among pathologists. Future work may examine the utility of these models for identifying infants at risk of systemic inflammatory response or early onset neonatal sepsis.</p></details> |  |

This leads to a late diagnosis of the tumor, where the curability likelihood is lower, and makes the mortality rate of Renal Cell Carcinoma high, with respect to its incidence rate. To increase the survival chance, a fast and correct categorization of the tumor subtype is paramount. Nowadays, computerized methods, based on artificial intelligence, represent an interesting opportunity to improve the productivity and the objectivity of the microscopy-based Renal Cell Carcinoma diagnosis. Nonetheless, much of their exploitation is hampered by the paucity of annotated dataset, essential for a proficient training of supervised machine learning technologies. This study sets out to investigate a novel self supervised training strategy for machine learning diagnostic tools, based on the multi-resolution nature of the histological samples. We aim at reducing the need of annotated dataset, without significantly reducing the accuracy of the tool. We demonstrate the classification capability of our tool on a whole slide imaging dataset for Renal Cancer subtyping, and we compare our solution with several state-of-the-art classification counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the gigapixel size of WSIs imposes significant computational challenges, limiting their practical utility. Our novel approach addresses these challenges by leveraging various encoders for intelligent data reduction and employing a different classification model to ensure robust, permutation-invariant representations of WSIs.

| **[Efficient Whole Slide Image Classification through Fisher Vector Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08530v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of digital pathology, particularly through computational analysis of whole slide images (WSI), is poised to significantly enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency. However, the large size and complexity of WSIs make it difficult to analyze and classify them using computers. This study introduces a novel method for WSI classification by automating the identification and examination of the most informative patches, thus eliminating the need to process the entire slide. Our method involves two-stages: firstly, it extracts only a few patches from the WSIs based on their pathological significance; and secondly, it employs Fisher vectors (FVs) for representing features extracted from these patches, which is known for its robustness in capturing fine-grained details. This approach not only accentuates key pathological features within the WSI representation but also significantly reduces computational overhead, thus making the process more efficient and scalable. We have rigorously evaluated the proposed method across multiple datasets to benchmark its performance against comprehensive WSI analysis and contemporary weakly-supervised learning methodologies. The empirical results indicate that our focused analysis of select patches, combined with Fisher vector representation, not only aligns with, but at times surpasses, the classification accuracy of standard practices. Moreover, this strategy notably diminishes computational load and resource expenditure, thereby establishing an efficient and precise framework for WSI analysis in the realm of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[CIMIL-CRC: a clinically-informed multiple instance learning framework for patient-level colorectal cancer molecular subtypes classification from H\&E stained images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16131v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Treatment approaches for colorectal cancer (CRC) are highly dependent on the molecular subtype, as immunotherapy has shown efficacy in cases with microsatellite instability (MSI) but is ineffective for the microsatellite stable (MSS) subtype. There is promising potential in utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) to automate the differentiation of CRC subtypes by analyzing Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). Due to the extensive size of WSIs, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques are typically explored. However, existing MIL methods focus on identifying the most representative image patches for classification, which may result in the loss of critical information. Additionally, these methods often overlook clinically relevant information, like the tendency for MSI class tumors to predominantly occur on the proximal (right side) colon. We introduce `CIMIL-CRC', a DNN framework that: 1) solves the MSI/MSS MIL problem by efficiently combining a pre-trained feature extraction model with principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate information from all patches, and 2) integrates clinical priors, particularly the tumor location within the colon, into the model to enhance patient-level classification accuracy. We assessed our CIMIL-CRC method using the average area under the curve (AUC) from a 5-fold cross-validation experimental setup for model development on the TCGA-CRC-DX cohort, contrasting it with a baseline patch-level classification, MIL-only approach, and Clinically-informed patch-level classification approach. Our CIMIL-CRC outperformed all methods (AUROC: $0.92\pm0.002$ (95\% CI 0.91-0.92), vs. $0.79\pm0.02$ (95\% CI 0.76-0.82), $0.86\pm0.01$ (95\% CI 0.85-0.88), and $0.87\pm0.01$ (95\% CI 0.86-0.88), respectively).

| **[Efficient Self-Supervised Barlow Twins from Limited Tissue Slide Cohorts for Colonic Pathology Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05959v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the few cancers that have an established dysplasia-carcinoma sequence that benefits from screening. Everyone over 50 years of age in Canada is eligible for CRC screening. About 20\% of those people will undergo a biopsy for a pre-neoplastic polyp and, in many cases, multiple polyps. As such, these polyp biopsies make up the bulk of a pathologist's workload. Developing an efficient computational model to help screen these polyp biopsies can improve the pathologist's workflow and help guide their attention to critical areas on the slide. DL models face significant challenges in computational pathology (CPath) because of the gigapixel image size of whole-slide images and the scarcity of detailed annotated datasets. It is, therefore, crucial to leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to alleviate the burden and cost of data annotation. However, current research lacks methods to apply SSL frameworks to analyze pathology data effectively. This paper aims to propose an optimized Barlow Twins framework for colorectal polyps screening. We adapt its hyperparameters, augmentation strategy and encoder to the specificity of the pathology data to enhance performance. Additionally, we investigate the best Field of View (FoV) for colorectal polyps screening and propose a new benchmark dataset for CRC screening, made of four types of colorectal polyps and normal tissue, by performing downstream tasking on MHIST and NCT-CRC-7K datasets. Furthermore, we show that the SSL representations are more meaningful and qualitative than the supervised ones and that Barlow Twins benefits from the Swin Transformer when applied to pathology data.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, the development of numerous models based on convolutional neural networks and transformer-based models has been applied to the precise segmentation of WSIs. However, due to privacy regulations and the need to protect patient confidentiality, centralized storage and processing of image data are impractical. Training a centralized model directly is challenging to implement in medical settings due to these privacy concerns.This paper addresses the dispersed nature and privacy sensitivity of medical image data by employing a federated learning framework, allowing medical institutions to collaboratively learn while protecting patient privacy. Additionally, to address the issue of original data reconstruction through gradient inversion during the federated learning training process, differential privacy introduces noise into the model updates, preventing attackers from inferring the contributions of individual samples, thereby protecting the privacy of the training data.Experimental results show that the proposed method, FedDP, minimally impacts model accuracy while effectively safeguarding the privacy of cancer pathology image data, with only a slight decrease in Dice, Jaccard, and Acc indices by 0.55%, 0.63%, and 0.42%, respectively. This approach facilitates cross-institutional collaboration and knowledge sharing while protecting sensitive data privacy, providing a viable solution for further research and application in the medical field.</p></details> | Accepted in BIBM2024 |

However, it remains an open question which factors are most important for downstream performance with data scale and diversity, model size, and training algorithm all playing a role. In this work, we propose algorithmic modifications, tailored for pathology, and we present the result of scaling both data and model size, surpassing previous studies in both dimensions. We introduce three new models: Virchow2, a 632 million parameter vision transformer, Virchow2G, a 1.9 billion parameter vision transformer, and Virchow2G Mini, a 22 million parameter distillation of Virchow2G, each trained with 3.1 million histopathology whole slide images, with diverse tissues, originating institutions, and stains. We achieve state of the art performance on 12 tile-level tasks, as compared to the top performing competing models. Our results suggest that data diversity and domain-specific methods can outperform models that only scale in the number of parameters, but, on average, performance benefits from the combination of domain-specific methods, data scale, and model scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Transfer Learning and Multiple Instance Learning for HER2 Automatic Scoring of H\&E Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05028v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker in breast cancer patients who can benefit from cost-effective automatic Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) HER2 scoring. However, developing such scoring models requires large pixel-level annotated datasets. Transfer learning allows prior knowledge from different datasets to be reused while multiple-instance learning (MIL) allows the lack of detailed annotations to be mitigated. The aim of this work is to examine the potential of transfer learning on the performance of deep learning models pre-trained on (i) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, (ii) H\&E images and (iii) non-medical images. A MIL framework with an attention mechanism is developed using pre-trained models as patch-embedding models. It was found that embedding models pre-trained on H\&E images consistently outperformed the others, resulting in an average AUC-ROC value of $0.622$ across the 4 HER2 scores ($0.59-0.80$ per HER2 score). Furthermore, it was found that using multiple-instance learning with an attention layer not only allows for good classification results to be achieved, but it can also help with producing visual indication of HER2-positive areas in the H\&E slide image by utilising the patch-wise attention weights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine learning identification of maternal inflammatory response and histologic choroamnionitis from placental membrane whole slide images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02354v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The placenta forms a critical barrier to infection through pregnancy, labor and, delivery. Inflammatory processes in the placenta have short-term, and long-term consequences for offspring health. Digital pathology and machine learning can play an important role in understanding placental inflammation, and there have been very few investigations into methods for predicting and understanding Maternal Inflammatory Response (MIR). This work intends to investigate the potential of using machine learning to understand MIR based on whole slide images (WSI), and establish early benchmarks. To that end, we use Multiple Instance Learning framework with 3 feature extractors: ImageNet-based EfficientNet-v2s, and 2 histopathology foundation models, UNI and Phikon to investigate predictability of MIR stage from histopathology WSIs. We also interpret predictions from these models using the learned attention maps from these models. We also use the MIL framework for predicting white blood cells count (WBC) and maximum fever temperature ($T_{max}$). Attention-based MIL models are able to classify MIR with a balanced accuracy of up to 88.5% with a Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa$) of up to 0.772. Furthermore, we found that the pathology foundation models (UNI and Phikon) are both able to achieve higher performance with balanced accuracy and $\kappa$, compared to ImageNet-based feature extractor (EfficientNet-v2s). For WBC and $T_{max}$ prediction, we found mild correlation between actual values and those predicted from histopathology WSIs. We used MIL framework for predicting MIR stage from WSIs, and compared effectiveness of foundation models as feature extractors, with that of an ImageNet-based model. We further investigated model failure cases and found them to be either edge cases prone to interobserver variability, examples of pathologist's overreach, or mislabeled due to processing errors.</p></details> |  |

However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology, as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,229 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and extensive metadata. HEST-1k was assembled from 153 public and internal cohorts encompassing 26 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 367 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 2.1 million expression--morphology pairs and over 76 million nuclei. To support its development, we additionally introduce the HEST-Library, a Python package designed to perform a range of actions with HEST samples. We test HEST-1k and Library on three use cases: (1) benchmarking foundation models for pathology (HEST-Benchmark), (2) biomarker exploration, and (3) multimodal representation learning. HEST-1k, HEST-Library, and HEST-Benchmark can be freely accessed at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/hest.</p></details> | NeurIPS'24 Spotlight |
| **[How Good Are We? Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MamMIL: Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images with State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05160v3)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pathological diagnosis has achieved superior performance by combining deep learning models with the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework using whole slide images (WSIs). However, the giga-pixeled nature of WSIs poses a great challenge for efficient MIL. Existing studies either do not consider global dependencies among instances, or use approximations such as linear attentions to model the pair-to-pair instance interactions, which inevitably brings performance bottlenecks. To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework named MamMIL for WSI analysis by cooperating the selective structured state space model (i.e., Mamba) with MIL, enabling the modeling of global instance dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. Specifically, considering the irregularity of the tissue regions in WSIs, we represent each WSI as an undirected graph. To address the problem that Mamba can only process 1D sequences, we further propose a topology-aware scanning mechanism to serialize the WSI graphs while preserving the topological relationships among the instances. Finally, in order to further perceive the topological structures among the instances and incorporate short-range feature interactions, we propose an instance aggregation block based on graph neural networks. Experiments show that MamMIL can achieve advanced performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/Vison307/MamMIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.

Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths. The model is made freely available in FastPathology and the code is available at https://github.com/AICAN-Research/breast-epithelium-segmentation</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

Most multimodal deep learning approaches use modality-specific architectures that are often trained separately and cannot capture the crucial cross-modal information that motivates the integration of different data sources. This paper presents the Hybrid Early-fusion Attention Learning Network (HEALNet): a flexible multimodal fusion architecture, which a) preserves modality-specific structural information, b) captures the cross-modal interactions and structural information in a shared latent space, c) can effectively handle missing modalities during training and inference, and d) enables intuitive model inspection by learning on the raw data input instead of opaque embeddings. We conduct multimodal survival analysis on Whole Slide Images and Multi-omic data on four cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). HEALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other end-to-end trained fusion models, substantially improving over unimodal and multimodal baselines whilst being robust in scenarios with missing modalities.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In this study, we developed a deep learning model to classify activity grades in hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from patients with IBD, offering a robust approach for general pathologists. We utilized 2,077 WSIs from 636 patients treated at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in 2018 and 2019, scanned at 40x magnification (0.25 micron/pixel). Board-certified gastrointestinal pathologists categorized the WSIs into four activity classes: inactive, mildly active, moderately active, and severely active. A transformer-based model was developed and validated using five-fold cross-validation to classify IBD activity. Using HoVerNet, we examined neutrophil distribution across activity grades. Attention maps from our model highlighted areas contributing to its prediction. The model classified IBD activity with weighted averages of 0.871 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.860-0.883] for the area under the curve, 0.695 [95% CI: 0.674-0.715] for precision, 0.697 [95% CI: 0.678-0.716] for recall, and 0.695 [95% CI: 0.674-0.714] for F1-score. Neutrophil distribution was significantly different across activity classes. Qualitative evaluation of attention maps by a gastrointestinal pathologist suggested their potential for improved interpretability. Our model demonstrates robust diagnostic performance and could enhance consistency and efficiency in IBD activity assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCT-HistoTransformer: Efficient Lightweight Vision Transformer with DCT Integration for histopathological image analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19166v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the integration of advanced imaging techniques and deep learning methods has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for breast cancer detection and classification. Transformers, which have shown great promise in computer vision, are now being applied to medical image analysis. However, their application to histopathological images presents challenges due to the need for extensive manual annotations of whole-slide images (WSIs), as these models require large amounts of data to work effectively, which is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, the quadratic computational cost of Vision Transformers (ViTs) is particularly prohibitive for large, high-resolution histopathological images, especially on edge devices with limited computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel lightweight breast cancer classification approach using transformers that operates effectively without large datasets. By incorporating parallel processing pathways for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Attention and MobileConv, we convert image data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain to utilize the benefits such as filtering out high frequencies in the image, which reduces computational cost. This demonstrates the potential of our approach to improve breast cancer classification in histopathological images, offering a more efficient solution with reduced reliance on extensive annotated datasets. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 96.00% $\pm$ 0.48% for binary classification and 87.85% $\pm$ 0.93% for multiclass classification, which is comparable to state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational costs. This demonstrates the potential of our approach to improve breast cancer classification in histopathological images, offering a more efficient solution with reduced reliance on extensive annotated datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for 2024 9th International Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)</p></details> |

The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). We will fully release SlideChat, SlideInstruction and SlideBench as open-source resources to facilitate research and development in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods cannot effectively capture the intricate interaction features among instances within the local area of WSI. Moreover, existing methods for cancer survival prediction based on WSI often fail to provide better clinically meaningful predictions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Sparse Context-aware Multiple Instance Learning (SCMIL) framework for predicting cancer survival probability distributions. SCMIL innovatively segments patches into various clusters based on their morphological features and spatial location information, subsequently leveraging sparse self-attention to discern the relationships between these patches with a context-aware perspective. Considering many patches are irrelevant to the task, we introduce a learnable patch filtering module called SoftFilter, which ensures that only interactions between task-relevant patches are considered. To enhance the clinical relevance of our prediction, we propose a register-based mixture density network to forecast the survival probability distribution for individual patients. We evaluate SCMIL on two public WSI datasets from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) specifically focusing on lung adenocarcinom (LUAD) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Our experimental results indicate that SCMIL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for survival prediction, offering more clinically meaningful and interpretable outcomes.

However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework.

| **[Rethinking Transformer for Long Contextual Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14195v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard for clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop computer-aided diagnosis model for WSIs, previous methods typically employ Multi-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level labels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise interactions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model contextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized to address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long sequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL employs approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from suboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use of absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long contextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze how the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the representation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of attention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local attention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the attention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the local attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation, reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local bandwidth. Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration and local-global information interactions modelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through extensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority. Our code will be available at github.com/invoker-LL/Long-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS-2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.12885</p></details> |
| **[De-Identification of Medical Imaging Data: A Comprehensive Tool for Ensuring Patient Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12402v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical data employed in research frequently comprises sensitive patient health information (PHI), which is subject to rigorous legal frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Consequently, these types of data must be pseudonymized prior to utilisation, which presents a significant challenge for many researchers. Given the vast array of medical data, it is necessary to employ a variety of de-identification techniques. To facilitate the anonymization process for medical imaging data, we have developed an open-source tool that can be used to de-identify DICOM magnetic resonance images, computer tomography images, whole slide images and magnetic resonance twix raw data. Furthermore, the implementation of a neural network enables the removal of text within the images. The proposed tool automates an elaborate anonymization pipeline for multiple types of inputs, reducing the need for additional tools used for de-identification of imaging data. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/code-lukas/medical_image_deidentification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence-Based Triaging of Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10509v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists are facing an increasing workload due to a growing volume of cases and the need for more comprehensive diagnoses. Aiming to facilitate workload reduction and faster turnaround times, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model for triaging cutaneous melanocytic lesions based on whole slide images. The AI model was developed and validated using a retrospective cohort from the UMC Utrecht. The dataset consisted of 52,202 whole slide images from 27,167 unique specimens, acquired from 20,707 patients. Specimens with only common nevi were assigned to the low complexity category (86.6%). In contrast, specimens with any other melanocytic lesion subtype, including non-common nevi, melanocytomas, and melanomas, were assigned to the high complexity category (13.4%). The dataset was split on patient level into a development set (80%) and test sets (20%) for independent evaluation. Predictive performance was primarily measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). A simulation experiment was performed to study the effect of implementing AI-based triaging in the clinic. The AI model reached an AUROC of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960-0.972) and an AUPRC of 0.857 (95% CI, 0.836-0.877) on the in-distribution test set, and an AUROC of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.860-0.934) and an AUPRC of 0.498 (95% CI, 0.360-0.639) on the out-of-distribution test set. In the simulation experiment, using random case assignment as baseline, AI-based triaging prevented an average of 43.9 (95% CI, 36-55) initial examinations of high complexity cases by general pathologists for every 500 cases. In conclusion, the AI model achieved a strong predictive performance in differentiating between cutaneous melanocytic lesions of high and low complexity. The improvement in workflow efficiency due to AI-based triaging could be substantial.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Slide-based Graph Collaborative Training for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10260v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of computational pathology lies in the consensus that pathological characteristics of tumors are significant guidance for cancer diagnostics. Most existing research focuses on the inner-contextual information within each WSI yet ignores the possible inter-correlations between slides. As the development of tumors is a continuous process involving a series of histological, morphological, and genetic changes that accumulate over time, the similarities and differences between WSIs across various stages, grades, locations and patients should potentially contribute to the representation of WSIs and deserve to be taken into account in WSI modeling. To verify the advancement of introducing the slide inter-correlations into the representation learning of WSIs, we proposed a generic WSI analysis pipeline SlideGCD that can be adapted to any existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks and improve their performance. With the new paradigm, the prior knowledge of cancer development can participate in the end-to-end workflow, which concurrently initializes and refines the slide representation, as a guide for message passing in the slide-based graph. Extensive comparisons and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed pipeline across 4 different tasks, including cancer subtyping, cancer staging, survival prediction, and gene mutation prediction, with 7 representative SOTA WSI analysis frameworks as backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMIL: Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Cancer Detection and Subtyping in Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05314v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visual examination of tissue biopsy sections is fundamental for cancer diagnosis, with pathologists analyzing sections at multiple magnifications to discern tumor cells and their subtypes. However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\%, 95.9\%, and 88.1\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CAMIL enhances model interpretability by identifying regions of high diagnostic value.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

However, current methods fall short in bridging the domain gap between pretrained models and medical imaging, and often fail to account for spatial relationships across different magnifications. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Concentric Dual Fusion Attention-MIL (CDFA-MIL) framework,which innovatively combines point-to-area feature-colum attention and point-to-point concentric-row attention using concentric patch. This approach is designed to effectively fuse correlated information, enhancing feature representation and providing stronger correlation guidance for WSI analysis. CDFA-MIL distinguishes itself by offering a robust fusion strategy that leads to superior WSI recognition. Its application has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly surpassing existing MIL methods in accuracy and F1 scores on prominent datasets like Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Specifically, CDFA-MIL achieved an average accuracy and F1-score of 93.7\% and 94.1\% respectively on these datasets, marking a notable advancement over traditional MIL approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need for additional experiments</p></details> |

They are intended to be general-purpose feature extractors, promising to achieve good performance on a range of downstream tasks. Real-world pathology image data does however exhibit considerable variability. Foundation models should be robust to these variations and other distribution shifts which might be encountered in practice. We evaluate two computational pathology foundation models: UNI (trained on more than 100,000 whole-slide images) and CONCH (trained on more than 1.1 million image-caption pairs), by utilizing them as feature extractors within prostate cancer grading models. We find that while UNI and CONCH perform well relative to baselines, the absolute performance can still be far from satisfactory in certain settings. The fact that foundation models have been trained on large and varied datasets does not guarantee that downstream models always will be robust to common distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

However, the practicability of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs has not yet been validated in real-world practice. In this paper, we applied LAF to two tasks of tumour segmentation for breast cancer (TSfBC) in medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA) for evaluations with IAGTLs. Experimental results and analysis show that the LAF-based evaluations with IAGTLs were unable to confidently act like usual evaluations with accurate ground-truth labels on the one easier task of TSfBC while being able to reasonably act like usual evaluations with AGTLs on the other more difficult task of TSfBC. These results and analysis reflect the potential of LAF applied to MHWSIA for evaluations with IAGTLs. This paper presents the first practical validation of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs in a real-world application.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the final published version</p></details> |

A WSI, acquired at gigapixel size, is commonly tiled into patches and processed by multiple-instance learning (MIL) models. Previous MIL-based models designed for this problem have only been evaluated on individual tasks for specific organs, and the ability to handle multiple tasks within a single model has not been investigated. In this study, we propose MECFormer, a generative Transformer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks within one model. To leverage the power of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and to enhance the model's effectiveness in focusing on each individual task, we introduce an Expert Consultation Network, a projection layer placed at the beginning of the Transformer-based model. Additionally, to enable flexible classification, autoregressive decoding is incorporated by a language decoder for WSI classification. Through extensive experiments on five datasets involving four different organs, one cancer classification task, and four cancer subtyping tasks, MECFormer demonstrates superior performance compared to individual state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ACCV2024</p></details> |

Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

State-of-the-art methods use self-supervised patch-wise feature representations for multiple instance learning (MIL). Recently, methods have been proposed to fine-tune the feature representation on the downstream task using pseudo labeling, but mostly focusing on selecting high-quality positive patches. In this paper, we propose to mine hard negative samples during fine-tuning. This allows us to obtain better feature representations and reduce the training cost. Furthermore, we propose a novel patch-wise ranking loss in MIL to better exploit these hard negative samples. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of these proposed ideas.

In this paper, we present a novel approach that uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for automatic melanoma segmentation in microscopy slide images. Our method employs an initial semantic segmentation model to generate preliminary segmentation masks that are then used to prompt SAM. We design a dynamic prompting strategy that uses a combination of centroid and grid prompts to achieve optimal coverage of the super high-resolution slide images while maintaining the quality of generated prompts. To optimize for invasive melanoma segmentation, we further refine the prompt generation process by implementing in-situ melanoma detection and low-confidence region filtering. We select Segformer as the initial segmentation model and EfficientSAM as the segment anything model for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only surpasses other state-of-the-art melanoma segmentation methods but also significantly outperforms the baseline Segformer by 9.1% in terms of IoU.</p></details> |  |
| **[WEEP: A method for spatial interpretation of weakly supervised CNN models in computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15238v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning enables the modelling of high-resolution histopathology whole-slide images (WSI). Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Seamless Virtual Immunohistochemical Whole Slide Images with Content and Color Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01072v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains play a vital role in a pathologist's analysis of medical images, providing crucial diagnostic information for various diseases. Virtual staining from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) allows the automatic production of other useful IHC stains without the expensive physical staining process. However, current virtual WSI generation methods based on tile-wise processing often suffer from inconsistencies in content, texture, and color at tile boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to artifacts that compromise image quality and potentially hinder accurate clinical assessment and diagnoses. To address this limitation, we propose a novel consistent WSI synthesis network, CC-WSI-Net, that extends GAN models to produce seamless synthetic whole slide images. Our CC-WSI-Net integrates a content- and color-consistency supervisor, ensuring consistency across tiles and facilitating the generation of seamless synthetic WSIs while ensuring Sox10 immunohistochemistry accuracy in melanocyte detection. We validate our method through extensive image-quality analyses, objective detection assessments, and a subjective survey with pathologists. By generating high-quality synthetic WSIs, our method opens doors for advanced virtual staining techniques with broader applications in research and clinical care.</p></details> |  |

While such WSI-based gene-expression prediction models have recently emerged within computational pathology, the high-dimensional nature of the corresponding regression problem offers numerous design choices which remain to be analyzed in detail. This study provides recommendations on how deep regression models should be trained for WSI-based gene-expression prediction. For example, we conclude that training a single model to simultaneously regress all 20530 genes is a computationally efficient yet very strong baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: A Dual-tier Few-Shot Learning Paradigm for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19720v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the primary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole Slide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike few-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of each image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small number of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in order to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining of available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address the above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level annotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs at the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to fully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch labels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the labels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch classification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior branch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of visual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the results from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches the accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\%$ annotation costs. All codes and models will be publicly available on https://github.com/fukexue/FAST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Quality Control of Whole Slide Pathology Images with Human-in-the-loop Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19587v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) are being widely used to develop deep learning-based diagnostic solutions, especially for precision oncology. Most of these diagnostic softwares are vulnerable to biases and impurities in the training and test data which can lead to inaccurate diagnoses. For instance, WSIs contain multiple types of tissue regions, at least some of which might not be relevant to the diagnosis. We introduce HistoROI, a robust yet lightweight deep learning-based classifier to segregate WSI into six broad tissue regions -- epithelium, stroma, lymphocytes, adipose, artifacts, and miscellaneous. HistoROI is trained using a novel human-in-the-loop and active learning paradigm that ensures variations in training data for labeling-efficient generalization. HistoROI consistently performs well across multiple organs, despite being trained on only a single dataset, demonstrating strong generalization. Further, we have examined the utility of HistoROI in improving the performance of downstream deep learning-based tasks using the CAMELYON breast cancer lymph node and TCGA lung cancer datasets. For the former dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for metastasis versus normal tissue of a neural network trained using weakly supervised learning increased from 0.88 to 0.92 by filtering the data using HistoROI. Similarly, the AUC increased from 0.88 to 0.93 for the classification between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma on the lung cancer dataset. We also found that the performance of the HistoROI improves upon HistoQC for artifact detection on a test dataset of 93 annotated WSIs. The limitations of the proposed model are analyzed, and potential extensions are also discussed.</p></details> | 18 pages |

As a test for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections, Gram stains provide critical early data to inform patient treatment. Rapid and reliable analysis of Gram stains has been shown to be positively associated with better clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for improved tools to automate Gram stain analysis. In this work, we developed a novel transformer-based model for Gram-stained WSI classification, which is more scalable to large datasets than previous convolutional neural network (CNN) -based methods as it does not require patch-level manual annotations. We also introduce a large Gram stain dataset from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA) to evaluate our model, exploring the classification of five major categories of Gram-stained WSIs: Gram-positive cocci in clusters, Gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains, Gram-positive rods, Gram-negative rods, and slides with no bacteria. Our model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.858 (95% CI: 0.805, 0.905) and an AUC of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.922, 0.976) using five-fold nested cross-validation on our 475-slide dataset, demonstrating the potential of large-scale transformer models for Gram stain classification. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our trained model, which achieves strong performance on external datasets without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNICORN: A Deep Learning Model for Integrating Multi-Stain Data in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17775v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: The integration of multi-stain histopathology images through deep learning poses a significant challenge in digital histopathology. Current multi-modal approaches struggle with data heterogeneity and missing data. This study aims to overcome these limitations by developing a novel transformer model for multi-stain integration that can handle missing data during training as well as inference. Methods: We propose UNICORN (UNiversal modality Integration Network for CORonary classificatioN) a multi-modal transformer capable of processing multi-stain histopathology for atherosclerosis severity class prediction. The architecture comprises a two-stage, end-to-end trainable model with specialized modules utilizing transformer self-attention blocks. The initial stage employs domain-specific expert modules to extract features from each modality. In the subsequent stage, an aggregation expert module integrates these features by learning the interactions between the different data modalities. Results: Evaluation was performed using a multi-class dataset of atherosclerotic lesions from the Munich Cardiovascular Studies Biobank (MISSION), using over 4,000 paired multi-stain whole slide images (WSIs) from 170 deceased individuals on 7 prespecified segments of the coronary tree, each stained according to four histopathological protocols. UNICORN achieved a classification accuracy of 0.67, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. The model effectively identifies relevant tissue phenotypes across stainings and implicitly models disease progression. Conclusion: Our proposed multi-modal transformer model addresses key challenges in medical data analysis, including data heterogeneity and missing modalities. Explainability and the model's effectiveness in predicting atherosclerosis progression underscores its potential for broader applications in medical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[HER2 and FISH Status Prediction in Breast Biopsy H&E-Stained Images Using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13818v3)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current standard for detecting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer patients relies on HER2 amplification, identified through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) tumor stains are more widely available, and accurately predicting HER2 status using H\&E could reduce costs and expedite treatment selection. Deep Learning algorithms for H&E have shown effectiveness in predicting various cancer features and clinical outcomes, including moderate success in HER2 status prediction. In this work, we employed a customized weak supervision classification technique combined with MoCo-v2 contrastive learning to predict HER2 status. We trained our pipeline on 182 publicly available H&E Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), for which annotations by the pathology team at Yale School of Medicine are publicly available. Our pipeline achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 across four different test folds. Additionally, we tested our model on 44 H&E slides from the TCGA-BRCA dataset, which had an HER2 score of 2+ and included corresponding HER2 status and FISH test results. These cases are considered equivocal for IHC, requiring an expensive FISH test on their IHC slides for disambiguation. Our pipeline demonstrated an AUC of 0.81 on these challenging H&E slides. Reducing the need for FISH test can have significant implications in cancer treatment equity for underserved populations.</p></details> |  |

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |

Current prognostic tools like Oncotype DX (ODX) offer valuable genomic insights for HR+/HER2- patients but are limited by cost and accessibility, particularly in underserved populations. In this study, we present Deep-BCR-Auto, a deep learning-based computational pathology approach that predicts breast cancer recurrence risk from routine H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Our methodology was validated on two independent cohorts: the TCGA-BRCA dataset and an in-house dataset from The Ohio State University (OSU). Deep-BCR-Auto demonstrated robust performance in stratifying patients into low- and high-recurrence risk categories. On the TCGA-BRCA dataset, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.827, significantly outperforming existing weakly supervised models (p=0.041). In the independent OSU dataset, Deep-BCR-Auto maintained strong generalizability, achieving an AUROC of 0.832, along with 82.0% accuracy, 85.0% specificity, and 67.7% sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of computational pathology as a cost-effective alternative for recurrence risk assessment, broadening access to personalized treatment strategies. This study underscores the clinical utility of integrating deep learning-based computational pathology into routine pathological assessment for breast cancer prognosis across diverse clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic and Historical Instance Comparison for Cervical Cell Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13987v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cytology screening from Papanicolaou (Pap) smears is a common and effective tool for the preventive clinical management of cervical cancer, where abnormal cell detection from whole slide images serves as the foundation for reporting cervical cytology. However, cervical cell detection remains challenging due to 1) hazily-defined cell types (e.g., ASC-US) with subtle morphological discrepancies caused by the dynamic cancerization process, i.e., cell class ambiguity, and 2) imbalanced class distributions of clinical data may cause missed detection, especially for minor categories, i.e., cell class imbalance. To this end, we propose a holistic and historical instance comparison approach for cervical cell detection. Specifically, we first develop a holistic instance comparison scheme enforcing both RoI-level and class-level cell discrimination. This coarse-to-fine cell comparison encourages the model to learn foreground-distinguishable and class-wise representations. To emphatically improve the distinguishability of minor classes, we then introduce a historical instance comparison scheme with a confident sample selection-based memory bank, which involves comparing current embeddings with historical embeddings for better cell instance discrimination. Extensive experiments and analysis on two large-scale cytology datasets including 42,592 and 114,513 cervical cells demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

However, this integration of multimodal data, specifically histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genetic sequencing data, presents unique challenges due to modality disparities and the need for scalable computational solutions. This paper addresses the scarcity of multimodal solutions, primarily centered around unimodal data solutions, thus limiting the realization of the rich insights that can be derived from integrating images and genomic data. Here, we introduce MarbliX ``Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX,'' an innovative multimodal framework that integrates histopathology images with immunogenomic sequencing data, encapsulating them into a concise binary patient code, referred to as ``monogram.'' This binary representation facilitates the establishment of a comprehensive archive, enabling clinicians to match similar cases. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of MarbliX to empower healthcare professionals with in-depth insights, leading to more precise diagnoses, reduced variability, and expanded personalized treatment options, particularly in the context of cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Aggregator with Mask Denoise Mechanism for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11664v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology analysis is the gold standard for medical diagnosis. Accurate classification of whole slide images (WSIs) and region-of-interests (ROIs) localization can assist pathologists in diagnosis. The gigapixel resolution of WSI and the absence of fine-grained annotations make direct classification and analysis challenging. In weakly supervised learning, multiple instance learning (MIL) presents a promising approach for WSI classification. The prevailing strategy is to use attention mechanisms to measure instance importance for classification. However, attention mechanisms fail to capture inter-instance information, and self-attention causes quadratic computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose AMD-MIL, an agent aggregator with a mask denoise mechanism. The agent token acts as an intermediate variable between the query and key for computing instance importance. Mask and denoising matrices, mapped from agents-aggregated value, dynamically mask low-contribution representations and eliminate noise. AMD-MIL achieves better attention allocation by adjusting feature representations, capturing micro-metastases in cancer, and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, CAMELYON-17, TCGA-KIDNEY, and TCGA-LUNG show AMD-MIL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Cohort Framework with Cohort-Aware Attention and Adversarial Mutual-Information Minimization for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11119v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are critical for various clinical applications, including histopathological analysis. However, current deep learning approaches in this field predominantly focus on individual tumor types, limiting model generalization and scalability. This relatively narrow focus ultimately stems from the inherent heterogeneity in histopathology and the diverse morphological and molecular characteristics of different tumors. To this end, we propose a novel approach for multi-cohort WSI analysis, designed to leverage the diversity of different tumor types. We introduce a Cohort-Aware Attention module, enabling the capture of both shared and tumor-specific pathological patterns, enhancing cross-tumor generalization. Furthermore, we construct an adversarial cohort regularization mechanism to minimize cohort-specific biases through mutual information minimization. Additionally, we develop a hierarchical sample balancing strategy to mitigate cohort imbalances and promote unbiased learning. Together, these form a cohesive framework for unbiased multi-cohort WSI analysis. Extensive experiments on a uniquely constructed multi-cancer dataset demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, providing a scalable solution for WSI classification across diverse cancer types. Our code for the experiments is publicly available at <link>.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Therefore, it is critical to develop and deploy reliable models, especially for healthcare applications. However, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models designed for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) classification in computational pathology are not evaluated in terms of reliability. Hence, in this paper we compare the reliability of MIL models with three suggested metrics and use three region-wise annotated datasets. We find the mean pooling instance (MEAN-POOL-INS) model more reliable than other networks despite its naive architecture design and computation efficiency.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been introduced for automated CRC subtype identification using H&E stained histopathological images, the correlation between CRC subtype genomic variants and their corresponding cellular morphology expressed by their imaging phenotypes is yet to be fully explored. The goal of this study was to determine such correlations by incorporating genomic variants in CNN models for CRC subtype classification from H&E images. We utilized the publicly available TCGA-CRC-DX dataset, which comprises whole slide images from 360 CRC-diagnosed patients (260 for training and 100 for testing). This dataset also provides information on CRC subtype classifications and genomic variations. We trained CNN models for CRC subtype classification that account for potential correlation between genomic variations within CRC subtypes and their corresponding cellular morphology patterns. We assessed the interplay between CRC subtypes' genomic variations and cellular morphology patterns by evaluating the CRC subtype classification accuracy of the different models in a stratified 5-fold cross-validation experimental setup using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and average precision (AP) as the performance metrics. Combining the CNN models account for variations in CIMP and SNP further improved classification accuracy (AUROC: 0.847$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.787$\pm$0.03, p$=$0.01, AP: 0.68$\pm$0.02 vs. 0.64$\pm$0.05).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show great promise across many tasks, but analyses have typically been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task. We report the most rigorous single-task validation of histopathology foundation models to date, specifically in ovarian cancer morphological subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using three ImageNet-pretrained feature extractors and fourteen histopathology foundation models. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for hold-out testing and external validation on the Transcanadian Study and OCEAN Challenge datasets. The best-performing model used the H-optimus-0 foundation model, with five-class balanced accuracies of 89%, 97%, and 74% in the test sets. Normalisations and augmentations aided the performance of the ImageNet-pretrained ResNets, but these were still outperformed by 13 of the 14 foundation models. Hyperparameter tuning the downstream classifiers improved performance by a median 1.9% balanced accuracy, with many improvements being statistically significant. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to ovarian cancer subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion to histopathologists diagnosing challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Classification of Histopathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13720v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses how to efficiently classify challenging histopathology images, such as gigapixel whole-slide images for cancer diagnostics with image-level annotation. We use images with annotated tumor regions to identify a set of tumor patches and a set of benign patches in a cancerous slide. Due to the variable nature of region of interest the tumor positive regions may refer to an extreme minority of the pixels. This creates an important problem during patch-level classification, where the majority of patches from an image labeled as 'cancerous' are actually tumor-free. This problem is different from semantic segmentation which associates a label to every pixel in an image, because after patch extraction we are only dealing with patch-level labels.Most existing approaches address the data imbalance issue by mitigating the data shortage in minority classes in order to prevent the model from being dominated by the majority classes. These methods include data re-sampling, loss re-weighting, margin modification, and data augmentation. In this work, we mitigate the patch-level class imbalance problem by taking a divide-and-conquer approach. First, we partition the data into sub-groups, and define three separate classification sub-problems based on these data partitions. Then, using an information-theoretic cluster-based sampling of deep image patch features, we sample discriminative patches from the sub-groups. Using these sampled patches, we build corresponding deep models to solve the new classification sub-problems. Finally, we integrate information learned from the respective models to make a final decision on the patches. Our result shows that the proposed approach can perform competitively using a very low percentage of the available patches in a given whole-slide image.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Accepted paper for the 27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Short Survey on Set-Based Aggregation Techniques for Single-Vector WSI Representation in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04615v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by enabling the digitization, storage, and analysis of tissue samples as whole slide images (WSIs). WSIs are gigapixel files that capture the intricate details of tissue samples, providing a rich source of information for diagnostic and research purposes. However, due to their enormous size, representing these images as one compact vector is essential for many computational pathology tasks, such as search and retrieval, to ensure efficiency and scalability. Most current methods are "patch-oriented," meaning they divide WSIs into smaller patches for processing, which prevents a holistic analysis of the entire slide. Additionally, the necessity for compact representation is driven by the expensive high-performance storage required for WSIs. Not all hospitals have access to such extensive storage solutions, leading to potential disparities in healthcare quality and accessibility. This paper provides an overview of existing set-based approaches to single-vector WSI representation, highlighting the innovations that allow for more efficient and effective use of these complex images in digital pathology, thus addressing both computational challenges and storage limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shapley Values-enabled Progressive Pseudo Bag Augmentation for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05490v4)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, whole-slide image (WSI) classification presents a formidable challenge due to its gigapixel resolution and limited fine-grained annotations. Multiple-instance learning (MIL) offers a weakly supervised solution, yet refining instance-level information from bag-level labels remains challenging. While most of the conventional MIL methods use attention scores to estimate instance importance scores (IIS) which contribute to the prediction of the slide labels, these often lead to skewed attention distributions and inaccuracies in identifying crucial instances. To address these issues, we propose a new approach inspired by cooperative game theory: employing Shapley values to assess each instance's contribution, thereby improving IIS estimation. The computation of the Shapley value is then accelerated using attention, meanwhile retaining the enhanced instance identification and prioritization. We further introduce a framework for the progressive assignment of pseudo bags based on estimated IIS, encouraging more balanced attention distributions in MIL models. Our extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, BRACS, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRCA datasets show our method's superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering enhanced interpretability and class-wise insights.

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention-mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and AMBIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.86$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.53$\pm$0.05, for tumor category, family and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disease Classification and Impact of Pretrained Deep Convolution Neural Networks on Diverse Medical Imaging Datasets across Imaging Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17011v2)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging techniques such as Chest X-rays, whole slide images, and optical coherence tomography serve as the initial screening and detection for a wide variety of medical pulmonary and ophthalmic conditions respectively. This paper investigates the intricacies of using pretrained deep convolutional neural networks with transfer learning across diverse medical imaging datasets with varying modalities for binary and multiclass classification. We conducted a comprehensive performance analysis with ten network architectures and model families each with pretraining and random initialization. Our finding showed that the use of pretrained models as fixed feature extractors yields poor performance irrespective of the datasets. Contrary, histopathology microscopy whole slide images have better performance. It is also found that deeper and more complex architectures did not necessarily result in the best performance. This observation implies that the improvements in ImageNet are not parallel to the medical imaging tasks. Within a medical domain, the performance of the network architectures varies within model families with shifts in datasets. This indicates that the performance of models within a specific modality may not be conclusive for another modality within the same domain. This study provides a deeper understanding of the applications of deep learning techniques in medical imaging and highlights the impact of pretrained networks across different medical imaging datasets under five different experimental settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression profiling are standard methods for molecular subtyping, IHC can be subjective, and gene profiling is costly and not widely accessible in many regions. Previous approaches have highlighted the potential application of deep learning models on H&E-stained whole slide images (WSI) for molecular subtyping, but these efforts vary in their methods, datasets, and reported performance. In this work, we investigated whether H&E-stained WSIs could be solely leveraged to predict breast cancer molecular subtypes (luminal A, B, HER2-enriched, and Basal). We used 1,433 WSIs of breast cancer in a two-step pipeline: first, classifying tumor and non-tumor tiles to use only the tumor regions for molecular subtyping; and second, employing a One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy to train four binary OvR classifiers and aggregating their results using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model. The pipeline was tested on 221 hold-out WSIs, achieving an overall macro F1 score of 0.95 for tumor detection and 0.73 for molecular subtyping. Our findings suggest that, with further validation, supervised deep learning models could serve as supportive tools for molecular subtyping in breast cancer. Our codes are made available to facilitate ongoing research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures (+4 supplementary figures), 4 tables</p></details> |

High-resolution WSIs are essential for precise diagnosis but technical limitations in scanning equipment and variablity in slide preparation can hinder obtaining these images. Super-resolution techniques can enhance low-resolution images; while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been effective in natural image super-resolution tasks, they often struggle with histopathology due to overfitting and mode collapse. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short in assessing the complex characteristics of histopathology images, necessitating robust histology-specific evaluation methods. We introduce Histo-Diffusion, a novel diffusion-based method specially designed for generating and evaluating super-resolution images in digital pathology. It includes a restoration module for histopathology prior and a controllable diffusion module for generating high-quality images. We have curated two histopathology datasets and proposed a comprehensive evaluation strategy which incorporates both full-reference and no-reference metrics to thoroughly assess the quality of digital pathology images. Comparative analyses on multiple datasets with state-of-the-art methods reveal that Histo-Diffusion outperforms GANs. Our method offers a versatile solution for histopathology image super-resolution, capable of handling multi-resolution generation from varied input sizes, providing valuable support in diagnostic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have submitted our paper to Medical Image Analysis and are currently awaiting feedback</p></details> |
| **[Mamba2MIL: State Space Duality Based Multiple Instance Learning for Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15032v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) has significantly advanced the clinical practice of pathology. Despite the progress made, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a promising paradigm within CPath, continues to face challenges, particularly related to incomplete information utilization. Existing frameworks, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), attention, and selective scan space state sequential model (SSM), lack sufficient flexibility and scalability in fusing diverse features, and cannot effectively fuse diverse features. Additionally, current approaches do not adequately exploit order-related and order-independent features, resulting in suboptimal utilization of sequence information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MIL framework called Mamba2MIL. Our framework utilizes the state space duality model (SSD) to model long sequences of patches of whole slide images (WSIs), which, combined with weighted feature selection, supports the fusion processing of more branching features and can be extended according to specific application needs. Moreover, we introduce a sequence transformation method tailored to varying WSI sizes, which enhances sequence-independent features while preserving local sequence information, thereby improving sequence information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mamba2MIL surpasses state-of-the-art MIL methods. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets, achieving improvements in nearly all performance metrics. Specifically, on the NSCLC dataset, Mamba2MIL achieves a binary tumor classification AUC of 0.9533 and an accuracy of 0.8794. On the BRACS dataset, it achieves a multiclass classification AUC of 0.7986 and an accuracy of 0.4981. The code is available at https://github.com/YuqiZhang-Buaa/Mamba2MIL.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, the identification and characterization of TLSs rely on immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining techniques, utilizing markers such as CD20 for B cells. Despite the specificity of IHC, Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining offers a more accessible and cost-effective choice. Capitalizing on the prevalence of H&E staining slides, we introduce a novel Mask-Guided Adversarial Transfer Learning method designed for virtual pathological staining. This method adeptly captures the nuanced color variations across diverse tissue types under various staining conditions, such as nucleus, red blood cells, positive reaction regions, without explicit label information, and adeptly synthesizes realistic IHC-like virtual staining patches, even replicating the positive reaction. Further, we propose the Virtual IHC Pathology Analysis Network (VIPA-Net), an integrated framework encompassing a Mask-Guided Transfer Module and an H&E-Based Virtual Staining TLS Detection Module. VIPA-Net synergistically harnesses both H\&E staining slides and the synthesized virtual IHC patches to enhance the detection of TLSs within H&E Whole Slide Images (WSIs). We evaluate the network with a comprehensive dataset comprising 1019 annotated slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Experimental results compellingly illustrate that the VIPA-Net substantially elevates TLS detection accuracy, effectively circumventing the need for actual CD20 staining across the public dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

However, the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of manual annotations present substantial challenges. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising weakly supervised learning approach for WSI classification. Recently research revealed employing pseudo bag augmentation can encourage models to learn various data, thus bolstering models' performance. While directly inheriting the parents' labels can introduce more noise by mislabeling in training. To address this issue, we translate the WSI classification task from weakly supervised learning to semi-weakly supervised learning, termed SWS-MIL, where adaptive pseudo bag augmentation (AdaPse) is employed to assign labeled and unlabeled data based on a threshold strategy. Using the "student-teacher" pattern, we introduce a feature augmentation technique, MergeUp, which merges bags with low-priority bags to enhance inter-category information, increasing training data diversity. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16, BRACS, and TCGA-LUNG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches, affirming its efficacy in WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce EXAONEPath, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. EXAONEPath is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs. Our experiments demonstrate that EXAONEPath significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared EXAONEPath with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that EXAONEPath achieves superior performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | License updated |

However, this paradigm relies on the use of a large number of labelled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases present significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with the pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI classification (FSWC) tasks. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC tasks. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multi-scale, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to get the WSI-level features. Based on two VLMs, extensive experiments and visualizations on three datasets demonstrated the powerful performance of our MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5tables</p></details> |

However, these assays are expensive, tissue destructive and often take weeks to complete. Using AI on routine H&E WSIs offers a fast and economical approach to screen for multiple molecular biomarkers. We present a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2, a foundation model pre-trained on 3 million slides, to interrogate genomic features previously determined by an next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, using 47,960 scanned hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSIs) from 38,984 cancer patients. Unlike traditional methods that train individual models for each biomarker or cancer type, our system employs a unified model to simultaneously predict a wide range of clinically relevant molecular biomarkers across cancer types. By training the network to replicate the MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel of 505 genes, it identified 80 high performing biomarkers with a mean AU-ROC of 0.89 in 15 most common cancer types. In addition, 40 biomarkers demonstrated strong associations with specific cancer histologic subtypes. Furthermore, 58 biomarkers were associated with targets frequently assayed clinically for therapy selection and response prediction. The model can also predict the activity of five canonical signaling pathways, identify defects in DNA repair mechanisms, and predict genomic instability measured by tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability (MSI), and chromosomal instability (CIN). The proposed model can offer potential to guide therapy selection, improve treatment efficacy, accelerate patient screening for clinical trials and provoke the interrogation of new therapeutic targets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data. This paper introduces the Hibou family of foundational vision transformers for pathology, leveraging the DINOv2 framework to pretrain two model variants, Hibou-B and Hibou-L, on a proprietary dataset of over 1 million whole slide images (WSIs) representing diverse tissue types and staining techniques. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance on both patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, Hibou-L achieves the highest average accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets.

The substantial size and complexity of WSIs pose unique analytical challenges. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing these challenges, particularly in cancer classification and detection. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and methodologies associated with applying MIL to WSI analysis, including attention mechanisms, pseudo-labeling, transformers, pooling functions, and graph neural networks. Additionally, it explores the potential of MIL in discovering cancer cell morphology, constructing interpretable machine learning models, and quantifying cancer grading.

| **[Attention Is Not What You Need: Revisiting Multi-Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09449v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although attention-based multi-instance learning algorithms have achieved impressive performances on slide-level whole slide image (WSI) classification tasks, they are prone to mistakenly focus on irrelevant patterns such as staining conditions and tissue morphology, leading to incorrect patch-level predictions and unreliable interpretability. Moreover, these attention-based MIL algorithms tend to focus on salient instances and struggle to recognize hard-to-classify instances. In this paper, we first demonstrate that attention-based WSI classification methods do not adhere to the standard MIL assumptions. From the standard MIL assumptions, we propose a surprisingly simple yet effective instance-based MIL method for WSI classification (FocusMIL) based on max-pooling and forward amortized variational inference. We argue that synergizing the standard MIL assumption with variational inference encourages the model to focus on tumour morphology instead of spurious correlations. Our experimental evaluations show that FocusMIL significantly outperforms the baselines in patch-level classification tasks on the Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC benchmarks. Visualization results show that our method also achieves better classification boundaries for identifying hard instances and mitigates the effect of spurious correlations between bags and labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[AEM: Attention Entropy Maximization for Multiple Instance Learning based Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15303v2)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has demonstrated effectiveness in analyzing whole slide images (WSIs), yet it often encounters overfitting challenges in real-world applications, particularly in the form of attention over-concentration. While existing methods to alleviate this issue introduce complex modules or processing steps, such as multiple-stage training and teacher-student distillation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective regularization: Attention Entropy Maximization (AEM). Motivated by our investigation revealing a positive correlation between attention entropy and model performance, AEM incorporates a negative entropy loss for attention values into the standard MIL framework, penalizing overly concentrated attention and encouraging the model to consider a broader range of informative regions in WSIs, potentially improving its generalization capabilities. Compared to existing overfitting mitigation methods, our AEM approach offers advantages of simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. It requires no additional modules or processing steps, involves only one hyperparameter, and demonstrates compatibility with MIL frameworks and techniques. These advantages make AEM particularly attractive for practical applications. We evaluate AEM on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Furthermore, AEM shows high versatility, integrating effectively with four feature extractors, two advanced MIL frameworks, three attention mechanisms, and Subsampling augmentation technique.

| **[HistoGym: A Reinforcement Learning Environment for Histopathological Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08847v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pathological research, education, and clinical practice, the decision-making process based on pathological images is critically important. This significance extends to digital pathology image analysis: its adequacy is demonstrated by the extensive information contained within tissue structures, which is essential for accurate cancer classification and grading. Additionally, its necessity is highlighted by the inherent requirement for interpretability in the conclusions generated by algorithms. For humans, determining tumor type and grade typically involves multi-scale analysis, which presents a significant challenge for AI algorithms. Traditional patch-based methods are inadequate for modeling such complex structures, as they fail to capture the intricate, multi-scale information inherent in whole slide images. Consequently, there is a pressing need for advanced AI techniques capable of efficiently and accurately replicating this complex analytical process. To address this issue, we introduce HistoGym, an open-source reinforcement learning environment for histopathological image analysis. Following OpenAI Gym APIs, HistoGym aims to foster whole slide image diagnosis by mimicking the real-life processes of doctors. Leveraging the pyramid feature of WSIs and the OpenSlide API, HistoGym provides a unified framework for various clinical tasks, including tumor detection and classification. We detail the observation, action, and reward specifications tailored for the histopathological image analysis domain and provide an open-source Python-based interface for both clinicians and researchers. To accommodate different clinical demands, we offer various scenarios for different organs and cancers, including both WSI-based and selected region-based scenarios, showcasing several noteworthy results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Its integration into safe clinical decision-making support requires robust and reliable models. However, real-world data comes with diversities that often lie outside the intended source distribution. Moreover, when test samples are dramatically different, clinical decision-making is greatly affected. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in models is crucial for well-calibrated predictions and determining when (or not) to trust a model. Unfortunately, many works have overlooked the importance of predictive uncertainty estimation. This paper evaluates whether predictive uncertainty estimation adds robustness to deep learning-based diagnostic decision-making systems. We investigate the effect of various carcinoma distribution shift scenarios on predictive performance and calibration. We first systematically investigate three popular methods for improving predictive uncertainty: Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensemble, and few-shot learning on lung adenocarcinoma classification as a primary disease in whole slide images. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness of the methods in terms of performance and calibration under clinically relevant distribution shifts such as in-distribution shifts comprising primary disease sub-types and other characterization analysis data; out-of-distribution shifts comprising well-differentiated cases, different organ origin, and imaging modality shifts. While studies on uncertainty estimation exist, to our best knowledge, no rigorous large-scale benchmark compares predictive uncertainty estimation including these dataset shifts for lung carcinoma classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</p></details> |  |

However, current methods do not explicitly characterize distributional differences between patch sets within WSIs. We introduce HistoKernel, a novel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) kernel that measures distributional similarity between WSIs for enhanced prediction performance on downstream prediction tasks. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates HistoKernel's effectiveness across various machine learning tasks, including retrieval (n = 9,362), drug sensitivity regression (n = 551), point mutation classification (n = 3,419), and survival analysis (n = 2,291), outperforming existing deep learning methods. Additionally, HistoKernel seamlessly integrates multi-modal data and offers a novel perturbation-based method for patch-level explainability. This work pioneers the use of kernel-based methods for WSI-level predictive modeling, opening new avenues for research.

| **[Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning: Developing an Instance-Level Classifier via Weakly-Supervised Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04813v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) problem is currently solved from either bag-classification or instance-classification perspective, both of which ignore important information contained in some instances and result in limited performance. For example, existing methods often face difficulty in learning hard positive instances. In this paper, we formulate MIL as a semi-supervised instance classification problem, so that all the labeled and unlabeled instances can be fully utilized to train a better classifier. The difficulty in this formulation is that all the labeled instances are negative in MIL, and traditional self-training techniques used in semi-supervised learning tend to degenerate in generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled instances in this scenario. To resolve this problem, we propose a weakly-supervised self-training method, in which we utilize the positive bag labels to construct a global constraint and a local constraint on the pseudo labels to prevent them from degenerating and force the classifier to learn hard positive instances. It is worth noting that easy positive instances are instances are far from the decision boundary in the classification process, while hard positive instances are those close to the decision boundary. Through iterative optimization, the pseudo labels can gradually approach the true labels. Extensive experiments on two MNIST synthetic datasets, five traditional MIL benchmark datasets and two histopathology whole slide image datasets show that our method achieved new SOTA performance on all of them. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multistain Pretraining for Slide Representation Learning in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02859v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing self-supervised learning (SSL) models that can learn universal and transferable representations of H&E gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is becoming increasingly valuable in computational pathology. These models hold the potential to advance critical tasks such as few-shot classification, slide retrieval, and patient stratification. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from small images (e.g., 224 x 224 patches) to entire slides, usually by aligning two different augmentations (or views) of the slide. Yet the resulting representation remains constrained by the limited clinical and biological diversity of the views. Instead, we postulate that slides stained with multiple markers, such as immunohistochemistry, can be used as different views to form a rich task-agnostic training signal. To this end, we introduce Madeleine, a multimodal pretraining strategy for slide representation learning. Madeleine is trained with a dual global-local cross-stain alignment objective on large cohorts of breast cancer samples (N=4,211 WSIs across five stains) and kidney transplant samples (N=12,070 WSIs across four stains). We demonstrate the quality of slide representations learned by Madeleine on various downstream evaluations, ranging from morphological and molecular classification to prognostic prediction, comprising 21 tasks using 7,299 WSIs from multiple medical centers.

| **[PathoDuet: Foundation Models for Pathological Slide Analysis of H&E and IHC Stains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09894v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large amounts of digitized histopathological data display a promising future for developing pathological foundation models via self-supervised learning methods. Foundation models pretrained with these methods serve as a good basis for downstream tasks. However, the gap between natural and histopathological images hinders the direct application of existing methods. In this work, we present PathoDuet, a series of pretrained models on histopathological images, and a new self-supervised learning framework in histopathology. The framework is featured by a newly-introduced pretext token and later task raisers to explicitly utilize certain relations between images, like multiple magnifications and multiple stains. Based on this, two pretext tasks, cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring, are designed to pretrain the model on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images and transfer the model to immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, respectively. To validate the efficacy of our models, we evaluate the performance over a wide variety of downstream tasks, including patch-level colorectal cancer subtyping and whole slide image (WSI)-level classification in H&E field, together with expression level prediction of IHC marker, tumor identification and slide-level qualitative analysis in IHC field. The experimental results show the superiority of our models over most tasks and the efficacy of proposed pretext tasks.

| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |
| **[The Importance of Downstream Networks in Digital Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a static downstream aggregation model setup, encompassing a fixed architecture and hyperparameters, a practice we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a sensitivity of feature extractor models towards aggregation model configurations, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen configurations. By accounting for this sensitivity, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the feature extractors' sensitivity to various aggregation model configurations, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of new foundation models in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SC-MIL: Sparsely Coded Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00048v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely used in weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification. Typical MIL methods include a feature embedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained feature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into predictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This involves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training as well as modeling the correlations between instances separately. In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that addresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary learning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances by expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete dictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings by suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To make the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we unrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling. The proposed SC module can be incorporated into any existing MIL framework in a plug-and-play manner with an acceptable computational cost. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed SC module could substantially boost the performance of state-of-the-art MIL methods.

We aim to bridge the gap between imaging and genomics data by leveraging transformer networks, allowing for accurate genomic profile predictions from CT/MRI images. Presently most studies rely on the use of whole slide images (WSI) for the association, which are obtained via invasive methodologies. We propose using only available CT/MRI images to predict genomic sequences. Our transformer based approach is able to efficiently generate associations between multiple sequences based on CT/MRI images alone. This work paves the way for the use of non-invasive imaging modalities for precise and personalized healthcare, allowing for a better understanding of diseases and treatment.</p></details> |  |

However, WSIs are costly, memory-intensive, and require extensive analysis time. As an alternative, microscopy-based analysis offers cost and memory efficiency, though microscopy images face issues with unknown absolute positions and redundant images due to multiple captures from the subjective perspectives of pathologists. To this end, we introduce MicroMIL, a weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically built to address these challenges by dynamically clustering images using deep cluster embedding (DCE) and Gumbel Softmax for representative image extraction. Graph edges are then constructed from the upper triangular similarity matrix, with nodes connected to their most similar neighbors, and a graph neural network (GNN) is utilized to capture local and diverse areas of contextual information. Unlike existing graph-based MIL methods designed for WSIs that require absolute positions, MicroMIL efficiently handles the graph edges without this need. Extensive evaluations on real-world colon cancer (Seegene) and public BreakHis datasets demonstrate that MicroMIL outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for patient diagnosis using microscopy images.

While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p < 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</p></details> |  |

Early screening via cytology Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis is critical to prevent this Cancer progression and improve survival rate, but pathologist's single test suffers inevitable false negative due to the immense number of cells that need to be reviewed within a WSI. Though computer-aided automated diagnostic models can serve as strong complement for pathologists, their effectiveness is hampered by the paucity of extensive and detailed annotations, coupled with the limited interpretability and robustness. These factors significantly hinder their practical applicability and reliability in clinical settings. To tackle these challenges, we develop an AI approach, which is a Scalable Technology for Robust and Interpretable Diagnosis built on Extensive data (STRIDE) of cervical cytology. STRIDE addresses the bottleneck of limited annotations by integrating patient-level labels with a small portion of cell-level labels through an end-to-end training strategy, facilitating scalable learning across extensive datasets. To further improve the robustness to real-world domain shifts of cytology slide-making and imaging, STRIDE employs color adversarial samples training that mimic staining and imaging variations. Lastly, to achieve pathologist-level interpretability for the trustworthiness in clinical settings, STRIDE can generate explanatory textual descriptions that simulates pathologists' diagnostic processes by cell image feature and textual description alignment. Conducting extensive experiments and evaluations in 183 medical centers with a dataset of 341,889 WSIs and 0.1 billion cells from cervical cytology patients, STRIDE has demonstrated a remarkable superiority over previous state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Cell Nuclei Instance Segmentation and Classification: Leveraging Context and Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18673v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manually annotating nuclei from the gigapixel Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is a laborious and costly task, meaning automated algorithms for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification could alleviate the workload of pathologists and clinical researchers and at the same time facilitate the automatic extraction of clinically interpretable features. But due to high intra- and inter-class variability of nuclei morphological and chromatic features, as well as H&E-stains susceptibility to artefacts, state-of-the-art algorithms cannot correctly detect and classify instances with the necessary performance. In this work, we hypothesise context and attention inductive biases in artificial neural networks (ANNs) could increase the generalization of algorithms for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification. We conduct a thorough survey on context and attention methods for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification from H&E-stained microscopy imaging, while providing a comprehensive discussion of the challenges being tackled with context and attention. Besides, we illustrate some limitations of current approaches and present ideas for future research. As a case study, we extend both a general instance segmentation and classification method (Mask-RCNN) and a tailored cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification model (HoVer-Net) with context- and attention-based mechanisms, and do a comparative analysis on a multi-centre colon nuclei identification and counting dataset. Although pathologists rely on context at multiple levels while paying attention to specific Regions of Interest (RoIs) when analysing and annotating WSIs, our findings suggest translating that domain knowledge into algorithm design is no trivial task, but to fully exploit these mechanisms, the scientific understanding of these methods should be addressed.</p></details> |  |

These characteristics make it difficult to capture the full spectrum of patterns, from subtle cellular abnormalities to complex tissue interactions, which are crucial for accurate prognosis. To address this, we propose CrossFusion, a novel multi-scale feature integration framework that extracts and fuses information from patches across different magnification levels. By effectively modeling both scale-specific patterns and their interactions, CrossFusion generates a rich feature set that enhances survival prediction accuracy. We validate our approach across six cancer types from public datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, when coupled with domain-specific feature extraction backbones, our method shows further gains in prognostic performance compared to general-purpose backbones.

| **[Foundation Models -- A Panacea for Artificial Intelligence in Pathology?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21264v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948; updated authors list format</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Accurate Gigapixel Pathological Image Classification with Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21130v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to processing numerous patches from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). To address this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance learning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance pre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In addition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based Kolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the performance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Classifier for Malignant Lymphoma Subtyping via Cell Graph and Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00925v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malignant lymphoma subtype classification directly impacts treatment strategies and patient outcomes, necessitating classification models that achieve both high accuracy and sufficient explainability. This study proposes a novel explainable Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) framework that identifies subtype-specific Regions of Interest (ROIs) from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) while integrating cell distribution characteristics and image information. Our framework simultaneously addresses three objectives: (1) indicating appropriate ROIs for each subtype, (2) explaining the frequency and spatial distribution of characteristic cell types, and (3) achieving high-accuracy subtyping by leveraging both image and cell-distribution modalities. The proposed method fuses cell graph and image features extracted from each patch in the WSI using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach and classifies subtypes within an MIL framework. Experiments on a dataset of 1,233 WSIs demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among ten comparative methods and provides region-level and cell-level explanations that align with a pathologist's perspectives.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figure |
| **[Multimodal Distillation-Driven Ensemble Learning for Long-Tailed Histopathology Whole Slide Images Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00915v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) plays a significant role in computational pathology, enabling weakly supervised analysis of Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets. The field of WSI analysis is confronted with a severe long-tailed distribution problem, which significantly impacts the performance of classifiers. Long-tailed distributions lead to class imbalance, where some classes have sparse samples while others are abundant, making it difficult for classifiers to accurately identify minority class samples. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble learning method based on MIL, which employs expert decoders with shared aggregators and consistency constraints to learn diverse distributions and reduce the impact of class imbalance on classifier performance. Moreover, we introduce a multimodal distillation framework that leverages text encoders pre-trained on pathology-text pairs to distill knowledge and guide the MIL aggregator in capturing stronger semantic features relevant to class information. To ensure flexibility, we use learnable prompts to guide the distillation process of the pre-trained text encoder, avoiding limitations imposed by specific prompts. Our method, MDE-MIL, integrates multiple expert branches focusing on specific data distributions to address long-tailed issues. Consistency control ensures generalization across classes. Multimodal distillation enhances feature extraction. Experiments on Camelyon+-LT and PANDA-LT datasets show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies.

| **["No negatives needed": weakly-supervised regression for interpretable tumor detection in whole-slide histopathology images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21109v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate tumor detection in digital pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as a widely used approach for weakly-supervised tumor detection with large-scale data without the need for manual annotations. However, traditional MIL methods often depend on classification tasks that require tumor-free cases as negative examples, which are challenging to obtain in real-world clinical workflows, especially for surgical resection specimens. We address this limitation by reformulating tumor detection as a regression task, estimating tumor percentages from WSIs, a clinically available target across multiple cancer types. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the proposed weakly-supervised regression framework by applying it to multiple organs, specimen types and clinical scenarios. We characterize the robustness of our framework to tumor percentage as a noisy regression target, and introduce a novel concept of amplification technique to improve tumor detection sensitivity when learning from small tumor regions. Finally, we provide interpretable insights into the model's predictions by analyzing visual attention and logit maps.

For accurate detection of HCC, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based architecture that uses transfer learning to extract the features from pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and a classifier made up of a sequence of fully connected layers. This study uses a publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC)database (n=491) for model development and database of Kasturba Gandhi Medical College (KMC), India for validation. The pre-processing step involves patch extraction, colour normalization, and augmentation that results in 3920 patches for the TCGA dataset. The developed hybrid deep neural network consisting of a CNN-based pre-trained feature extractor and a customized artificial neural network-based classifier is trained using five-fold cross-validation. For this study, eight different state-of-the-art models are trained and tested as feature extractors for the proposed hybrid model. The proposed hybrid model with ResNet50-based feature extractor provided the sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 1.00, respectively on the TCGA database. On the KMC database, EfficientNetb3 resulted in the optimal choice of the feature extractor giving sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 96.97, 98.85, 96.71, 96.71, and 0.99, respectively. The proposed hybrid models showed improvement in accuracy of 2% and 4% over the pre-trained models in TCGA-LIHC and KMC databases.</p></details> | 14 figure, 9 tables |

In computational pathology, domain-specific VLMs, which are pre-trained on extensive histopathology image-text datasets, have succeeded in various downstream tasks. However, existing research has primarily focused on the pre-training process and direct applications of VLMs on the patch level, leaving their great potential for whole slide image (WSI) applications unexplored. In this study, we hypothesize that pre-trained VLMs inherently capture informative and interpretable WSI representations through quantitative feature extraction. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce Vision and Language Embeddings for Explainable WSI Representation (VLEER), a novel method designed to leverage VLMs for WSI representation. We systematically evaluate VLEER on three pathological WSI datasets, proving its better performance in WSI analysis compared to conventional vision features. More importantly, VLEER offers the unique advantage of interpretability, enabling direct human-readable insights into the results by leveraging the textual modality for detailed pathology annotations, providing clear reasoning for WSI-level pathology downstream tasks.</p></details> | Under review |

Recent advances in domain generalization improve model transferability in terms of aggregated performance measured by the Area Under Curve (AUC). However, clinical regulations often require to control the transferability of other metrics, such as prescribed sensitivity levels. We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Validated across multiple cohorts and tasks, our method enables robust sensitivity control with only a handful of calibration samples, providing a practical solution for reliable deployment of computational pathology systems.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Can We Simplify Slide-level Fine-tuning of Pathology Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20823v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed histopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis being a core application. Traditionally, weakly supervised fine-tuning via multiple instance learning (MIL) has been the primary method for adapting foundation models to WSIs. However, in this work we present a key experimental finding: a simple nonlinear mapping strategy combining mean pooling and a multilayer perceptron, called SiMLP, can effectively adapt patch-level foundation models to slide-level tasks without complex MIL-based learning. Through extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of SiMLP with state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on a large-scale pan-cancer classification task, SiMLP surpasses popular MIL-based methods by 3.52%. Furthermore, SiMLP shows strong learning ability in few-shot classification and remaining highly competitive with slide-level foundation models pretrained on tens of thousands of slides. Finally, SiMLP exhibits remarkable robustness and transferability in lung cancer subtyping. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional MIL-based fine-tuning paradigm, demonstrating that a task-agnostic representation strategy alone can effectively adapt foundation models to WSI analysis. These insights offer a unique and meaningful perspective for future research in digital pathology, paving the way for more efficient and broadly applicable methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study.

Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[A Lightweight and Extensible Cell Segmentation and Classification Model for Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19217v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing clinically useful cell-level analysis tools in digital pathology remains challenging due to limitations in dataset granularity, inconsistent annotations, high computational demands, and difficulties integrating new technologies into workflows. To address these issues, we propose a solution that enhances data quality, model performance, and usability by creating a lightweight, extensible cell segmentation and classification model. First, we update data labels through cross-relabeling to refine annotations of PanNuke and MoNuSAC, producing a unified dataset with seven distinct cell types. Second, we leverage the H-Optimus foundation model as a fixed encoder to improve feature representation for simultaneous segmentation and classification tasks. Third, to address foundation models' computational demands, we distill knowledge to reduce model size and complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Finally, we integrate the distilled model into QuPath, a widely used open-source digital pathology platform. Results demonstrate improved segmentation and classification performance using the H-Optimus-based model compared to a CNN-based model. Specifically, average $R^2$ improved from 0.575 to 0.871, and average $PQ$ score improved from 0.450 to 0.492, indicating better alignment with actual cell counts and enhanced segmentation quality. The distilled model maintains comparable performance while reducing parameter count by a factor of 48. By reducing computational complexity and integrating into workflows, this approach may significantly impact diagnostics, reduce pathologist workload, and improve outcomes. Although the method shows promise, extensive validation is necessary prior to clinical deployment.</p></details> | 27 pages, 11 figures |
| **[From Traditional to Deep Learning Approaches in Whole Slide Image Registration: A Methodological Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19123v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) registration is an essential task for analysing the tumour microenvironment (TME) in histopathology. It involves the alignment of spatial information between WSIs of the same section or serial sections of a tissue sample. The tissue sections are usually stained with single or multiple biomarkers before imaging, and the goal is to identify neighbouring nuclei along the Z-axis for creating a 3D image or identifying subclasses of cells in the TME. This task is considerably more challenging compared to radiology image registration, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, due to various factors. These include gigapixel size of images, variations in appearance between differently stained tissues, changes in structure and morphology between non-consecutive sections, and the presence of artefacts, tears, and deformations. Currently, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding a review of the current approaches and their limitations, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the available approaches and their application for various purposes. Furthermore, we investigate current deep learning methods used for WSI registration, emphasising their diverse methodologies. We examine the available datasets and explore tools and software employed in the field. Finally, we identify open challenges and potential future trends in this area of research.</p></details> |  |

These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p></details> |  |

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Whole Slide Images (WSI) plays a crucial role by providing detailed tissue samples for the analysis and training of DL models. However, WSIs often contain regions with artifacts such as tissue folds, blurring, as well as non-tissue regions (background), which can negatively impact DL model performance. These artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant and can lead to inaccurate results. This paper proposes a fully automatic supervised DL pipeline for WSI Quality Assessment (WSI-QA) that uses a fused model combining CNNs and ViTs to detect and exclude WSI regions with artifacts, ensuring that only qualified WSI regions are used to build DL-based computational pathology applications. The proposed pipeline employs a pixel-based segmentation model to classify WSI regions as either qualified or non-qualified based on the presence of artifacts. The proposed model was trained on a large and diverse dataset and validated with internal and external data from various human organs, scanners, and H&E staining procedures. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WSI artifact detection. The proposed model consistently achieved over 95% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across all artifact types. Furthermore, the WSI-QA pipeline shows strong generalization across different tissue types and scanning conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis journal, February 2025</p></details> |

However, current methods are computationally inefficient, processing thousands of redundant tiles per WSI and requiring complex aggregator models. We introduce EAGLE (Efficient Approach for Guided Local Examination), a deep learning framework that emulates pathologists by selectively analyzing informative regions. EAGLE incorporates two foundation models: CHIEF for efficient tile selection and Virchow2 for extracting high-quality features. Benchmarking was conducted against leading slide- and tile-level foundation models across 31 tasks from four cancer types, spanning morphology, biomarker prediction and prognosis. EAGLE outperformed state-of-the-art foundation models by up to 23% and achieved the highest AUROC overall. It processed a slide in 2.27 seconds, reducing computational time by more than 99% compared to existing models. This efficiency enables real-time workflows, allows pathologists to validate all tiles which are used by the model during analysis, and eliminates dependence on high-performance computing, making AI-powered pathology more accessible. By reliably identifying meaningful regions and minimizing artifacts, EAGLE provides robust and interpretable outputs, supporting rapid slide searches, integration into multi-omics pipelines and emerging clinical foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides.

Trained histopathologists overcome this challenge by navigating the WSI, looking for relevant patches, taking notes, and compiling them to produce a final holistic diagnostic. Traditional AI approaches, such as multiple instance learning and transformer-based models, fail short of such a holistic, iterative, multi-scale diagnostic procedure, limiting their adoption in the real-world. We introduce PathFinder, a multi-modal, multi-agent framework that emulates the decision-making process of expert pathologists. PathFinder integrates four AI agents, the Triage Agent, Navigation Agent, Description Agent, and Diagnosis Agent, that collaboratively navigate WSIs, gather evidence, and provide comprehensive diagnoses with natural language explanations. The Triage Agent classifies the WSI as benign or risky; if risky, the Navigation and Description Agents iteratively focus on significant regions, generating importance maps and descriptive insights of sampled patches. Finally, the Diagnosis Agent synthesizes the findings to determine the patient's diagnostic classification. Our Experiments show that PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skin melanoma diagnosis by 8% while offering inherent explainability through natural language descriptions of diagnostically relevant patches. Qualitative analysis by pathologists shows that the Description Agent's outputs are of high quality and comparable to GPT-4o. PathFinder is also the first AI-based system to surpass the average performance of pathologists in this challenging melanoma classification task by 9%, setting a new record for efficient, accurate, and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostics in pathology.

However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> |

While AI-assisted cytology offers a cost-effective and non-invasive screening solution, current systems struggle with generalizability in complex clinical scenarios. To address this issue, we introduced Smart-CCS, a generalizable Cervical Cancer Screening paradigm based on pretraining and adaptation to create robust and generalizable screening systems. To develop and validate Smart-CCS, we first curated a large-scale, multi-center dataset named CCS-127K, which comprises a total of 127,471 cervical cytology whole-slide images collected from 48 medical centers. By leveraging large-scale self-supervised pretraining, our CCS models are equipped with strong generalization capability, potentially generalizing across diverse scenarios. Then, we incorporated test-time adaptation to specifically optimize the trained CCS model for complex clinical settings, which adapts and refines predictions, improving real-world applicability. We conducted large-scale system evaluation among various cohorts. In retrospective cohorts, Smart-CCS achieved an overall area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.965 and sensitivity of 0.913 for cancer screening on 11 internal test datasets. In external testing, system performance maintained high at 0.950 AUC across 6 independent test datasets. In prospective cohorts, our Smart-CCS achieved AUCs of 0.947, 0.924, and 0.986 in three prospective centers, respectively. Moreover, the system demonstrated superior sensitivity in diagnosing cervical cancer, confirming the accuracy of our cancer screening results by using histology findings for validation. Interpretability analysis with cell and slide predictions further indicated that the system's decision-making aligns with clinical practice. Smart-CCS represents a significant advancement in cancer screening across diverse clinical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Accurate cancer classification is essential for patient stratification and clinical decision-making. Although digital pathology has been advancing cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the paradigm in cancer pathology has shifted from purely relying on histology features to incorporating molecular markers. There is an urgent need for digital pathology methods to meet the needs of the new paradigm. We introduce a novel digital pathology approach to jointly predict molecular markers and histology features and model their interactions for cancer classification. Firstly, to mitigate the challenge of cross-magnification information propagation, we propose a multi-scale disentangling module, enabling the extraction of multi-scale features from high-magnification (cellular-level) to low-magnification (tissue-level) whole slide images. Further, based on the multi-scale features, we propose an attention-based hierarchical multi-task multi-instance learning framework to simultaneously predict histology and molecular markers. Moreover, we propose a co-occurrence probability-based label correlation graph network to model the co-occurrence of molecular markers. Lastly, we design a cross-modal interaction module with the dynamic confidence constrain loss and a cross-modal gradient modulation strategy, to model the interactions of histology and molecular markers. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying glioma, histology features and molecular markers. Our method promises to promote precise oncology with the potential to advance biomedical research and clinical applications.

While existing survival analysis (SA) approaches have made exciting progress, they are generally limited to adopting highly-expressive network architectures and only coarse-grained patient-level labels to learn visual prognostic representations from gigapixel WSIs. Such learning paradigm suffers from critical performance bottlenecks, when facing present scarce training data and standard multi-instance learning (MIL) framework in CPATH. To overcome it, this paper, for the first time, proposes a new Vision-Language-based SA (VLSA) paradigm. Concretely, (1) VLSA is driven by pathology VL foundation models. It no longer relies on high-capability networks and shows the advantage of data efficiency. (2) In vision-end, VLSA encodes textual prognostic prior and then employs it as auxiliary signals to guide the aggregating of visual prognostic features at instance level, thereby compensating for the weak supervision in MIL. Moreover, given the characteristics of SA, we propose i) ordinal survival prompt learning to transform continuous survival labels into textual prompts; and ii) ordinal incidence function as prediction target to make SA compatible with VL-based prediction. Notably, VLSA's predictions can be interpreted intuitively by our Shapley values-based method. The extensive experiments on five datasets confirm the effectiveness of our scheme. Our VLSA could pave a new way for SA in CPATH by offering weakly-supervised MIL an effective means to learn valuable prognostic clues from gigapixel WSIs.

However, training such models typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain experts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay annotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-agent-based approaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively, as they lack mechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both the image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware self-corrective AI agent that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its learning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and annotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with stronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted based on their feature similarity to high-confidence agreement regions, with more similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of reliable agreement regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm enables the AI to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness. Validated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two simulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation performance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its potential for training robust models on noisy datasets. The official implementation and cell annotations are publicly available at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/CASC-AI.</p></details> |  |

While kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for CKD diagnosis and treatment, the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for kidney pathology segmentation hinders progress in the field. To address this, we organized the Kidney Pathology Image Segmentation (KPIs) Challenge, introducing a dataset that incorporates preclinical rodent models of CKD with over 10,000 annotated glomeruli from 60+ Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS)-stained whole slide images. The challenge includes two tasks, patch-level segmentation and whole slide image segmentation and detection, evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and F1-score. By encouraging innovative segmentation methods that adapt to diverse CKD models and tissue conditions, the KPIs Challenge aims to advance kidney pathology analysis, establish new benchmarks, and enable precise, large-scale quantification for disease research and diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a general and practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs.

Traditional methods rely on complex hardware or iterative hill-climbing algorithms. Recent learning-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in a one-shot setting, avoiding hardware modifications or iterative mechanical lens adjustments. However, in this paper, we highlight a significant challenge that the richness of image content can significantly affect autofocus performance. When the image content is sparse, previous autofocus methods, whether traditional climbing-hill or learning-based, tend to fail. To tackle this, we propose a content-importance-based solution, named SparseFocus, featuring a novel two-stage pipeline. The first stage measures the importance of regions within the image, while the second stage calculates the defocus distance from selected important regions. To validate our approach and benefit the research community, we collect a large-scale dataset comprising millions of labelled defocused images, encompassing both dense, sparse and extremely sparse scenarios. Experimental results show that SparseFocus surpasses existing methods, effectively handling all levels of content sparsity. Moreover, we integrate SparseFocus into our Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) system that performs well in real-world applications. The code and dataset will be made available upon the publication of this paper.</p></details> |  |

Traditional cell segmentation approaches, while commonly used, are computationally expensive and require extensive post-processing, limiting their practicality for high-throughput clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from segmentation to detection for extracting cell information from WSIs, introducing CellNuc-DETR as a more effective solution. We evaluate the accuracy performance of CellNuc-DETR on the PanNuke dataset and conduct cross-dataset evaluations on CoNSeP and MoNuSeg to assess robustness and generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both cell nuclei detection and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of CellNuc-DETR on large WSIs, showing that it not only outperforms current methods in accuracy but also significantly reduces inference times. Specifically, CellNuc-DETR is twice as fast as the fastest segmentation-based method, HoVer-NeXt, while achieving substantially higher accuracy. Moreover, it surpasses CellViT in accuracy and is approximately ten times more efficient in inference speed on WSIs. These results establish CellNuc-DETR as a superior approach for cell analysis in digital pathology, combining high accuracy with computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Comprehensive datasets that combine histopathological images with genetic and survival data across various tumour sites are essential for advancing computational pathology and personalised medicine. $\textbf{Results}$: We present SurGen, a dataset comprising 1,020 H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from 843 colorectal cancer cases. The dataset includes detailed annotations for key genetic mutations (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) and mismatch repair status, as well as survival data for 426 cases. To demonstrate SurGen's practical utility, we conducted a proof-of-concept machine learning experiment predicting mismatch repair status from the WSIs, achieving a test AUROC of 0.8316. These preliminary results underscore the dataset's potential to facilitate research in biomarker discovery, prognostic modelling, and advanced machine learning applications in colorectal cancer. $\textbf{Conclusions}$: SurGen offers a valuable resource for the scientific community, enabling studies that require high-quality WSIs linked with comprehensive clinical and genetic information on colorectal cancer.

In this work, we present PathMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information on bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm, to probe and distil a classifier trained with bag-level information to obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the supervision for the same classifier in a finer way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose Two-Dimensional Positional Encoding (2DPE), which encodes the spatial appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. PathMIL is evaluated on multiple benchmarking tasks, including subtype classification (TCGA-NSCLC), tumour classification (CAMELYON16), and an internal benchmark for breast cancer receptor status classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with AUC scores of 0.9152 and 0.8524 for estrogen and progesterone receptor status classification, respectively, an AUC of 0.9618 for subtype classification, and 0.8634 for tumour classification, surpassing existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Cell Nuclei AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06381v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell nuclei instance segmentation is a crucial task in digital kidney pathology. Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Gap: Evaluating Patch Embeddings from General-Purpose and Histopathology Foundation Models for Cell Segmentation and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02471v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have transformed computer vision, driving significant performance improvements across diverse domains, including digital histopathology. However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Anything for Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00408v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nucleus segmentation is an important analysis task in digital pathology. However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/patho-sam.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Graph-based MIL and Interventional Training in the Generalization of WSI Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19048v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Imaging (WSI), which involves high-resolution digital scans of pathology slides, has become the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, but its gigapixel resolution and the scarcity of annotated datasets present challenges for deep learning models. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a widely-used weakly supervised approach, bypasses the need for patch-level annotations. However, conventional MIL methods overlook the spatial relationships between patches, which are crucial for tasks such as cancer grading and diagnosis. To address this, graph-based approaches have gained prominence by incorporating spatial information through node connections. Despite their potential, both MIL and graph-based models are vulnerable to learning spurious associations, like color variations in WSIs, affecting their robustness. In this dissertation, we conduct an extensive comparison of multiple graph construction techniques, MIL models, graph-MIL approaches, and interventional training, introducing a new framework, Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning with Interventional Training (GMIL-IT), for WSI classification. We evaluate their impact on model generalization through domain shift analysis and demonstrate that graph-based models alone achieve the generalization initially anticipated from interventional training.

While transformer architectures excel at modeling long-range correlations through self-attention, their quadratic computational complexity makes them impractical for computational pathology applications. Existing solutions like local-global or linear self-attention reduce computational costs but compromise the strong modeling capabilities of full self-attention. In this work, we propose Querent, i.e., the query-aware long contextual dynamic modeling framework, which maintains the expressive power of full self-attention while achieving practical efficiency. Our method adaptively predicts which surrounding regions are most relevant for each patch, enabling focused yet unrestricted attention computation only with potentially important contexts. By using efficient region-wise metadata computation and importance estimation, our approach dramatically reduces computational overhead while preserving global perception to model fine-grained patch correlations. Through comprehensive experiments on biomarker prediction, gene mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and survival analysis across over 10 WSI datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dddavid4real/Querent.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Hypergraph Representation for Bone Metastasis Cancer Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16787v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bone metastasis analysis is a significant challenge in pathology and plays a critical role in determining patient quality of life and treatment strategies. The microenvironment and specific tissue structures are essential for pathologists to predict the primary bone cancer origins and primary bone cancer subtyping. By digitizing bone tissue sections into whole slide images (WSIs) and leveraging deep learning to model slide embeddings, this analysis can be enhanced. However, tumor metastasis involves complex multivariate interactions with diverse bone tissue structures, which traditional WSI analysis methods such as multiple instance learning (MIL) fail to capture. Moreover, graph neural networks (GNNs), limited to modeling pairwise relationships, are hard to represent high-order biological associations. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic hypergraph neural network (DyHG) that overcomes the edge construction limitations of traditional graph representations by connecting multiple nodes via hyperedges. A low-rank strategy is used to reduce the complexity of parameters in learning hypergraph structures, while a Gumbel-Softmax-based sampling strategy optimizes the patch distribution across hyperedges. An MIL aggregator is then used to derive a graph-level embedding for comprehensive WSI analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of DyHG, we construct two large-scale datasets for primary bone cancer origins and subtyping classification based on real-world bone metastasis scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyHG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, showcasing its ability to model complex biological interactions and improve the accuracy of bone metastasis analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages,11 figures |

Despite these advances, foundation models are still limited in their ability to encode the entire gigapixel whole-slide images without additional training and often lack complementary multimodal data. Here, we introduce Threads, a slide-level foundation model capable of generating universal representations of whole-slide images of any size. Threads was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse cohort of 47,171 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections, paired with corresponding genomic and transcriptomic profiles - the largest such paired dataset to be used for foundation model development to date. This unique training paradigm enables Threads to capture the tissue's underlying molecular composition, yielding powerful representations applicable to a wide array of downstream tasks. In extensive benchmarking across 54 oncology tasks, including clinical subtyping, grading, mutation prediction, immunohistochemistry status determination, treatment response prediction, and survival prediction, Threads outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and label efficiency. It is particularly well suited for predicting rare events, further emphasizing its clinical utility. We intend to make the model publicly available for the broader community.</p></details> |  |

Because z-stacking can offer enhanced depth information compared to the single-layer whole slide imaging, this technology can be particularly useful in analyzing small-scaled histopathological patterns. However, its actual clinical impact remains debated with mixed results. To clarify this, we investigate the effect of z-stack scanning on artificial intelligence (AI) mitosis detection of meningiomas. With the same set of 22 Hematoxylin and Eosin meningioma glass slides scanned by three different digital pathology scanners, we tested the performance of three AI pipelines on both single-layer and z-stacked whole slide images (WSIs). Results showed that in all scanner-AI combinations, z-stacked WSIs significantly increased AI's sensitivity (+17.14%) on the mitosis detection with only a marginal impact on precision. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that highlights z-stack scanning as a promising technique for AI mitosis detection, paving the way for more reliable AI-assisted pathology workflows, which can ultimately benefit patient management.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear 2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Self-Supervised Grading of Prostate Cancer Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15520v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prostate cancer grading using the ISUP system (International Society of Urological Pathology) for treatment decisions is highly subjective and requires considerable expertise. Despite advances in computer-aided diagnosis systems, few have handled efficient ISUP grading on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of prostate biopsies based only on slide-level labels. Some of the general challenges include managing gigapixel WSIs, obtaining patch-level annotations, and dealing with stain variability across centers. One of the main task-specific challenges faced by deep learning in ISUP grading, is the learning of patch-level features of Gleason patterns (GPs) based only on their slide labels. In this scenario, an efficient framework for ISUP grading is developed. The proposed TSOR is based on a novel Task-specific Self-supervised learning (SSL) model, which is fine-tuned using Ordinal Regression. Since the diversity of training samples plays a crucial role in SSL, a patch-level dataset is created to be relatively balanced w.r.t. the Gleason grades (GGs). This balanced dataset is used for pre-training, so that the model can effectively learn stain-agnostic features of the GP for better generalization. In medical image grading, it is desirable that misclassifications be as close as possible to the actual grade. From this perspective, the model is then fine-tuned for the task of ISUP grading using an ordinal regression-based approach. Experimental results on the most extensive multicenter prostate biopsies dataset (PANDA challenge), as well as the SICAP dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, manually quantifying BVs in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images is challenging and labor-intensive due to their heterogeneous appearances. We propose a novel approach of constructing guiding maps to improve the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models for BV segmentation, the guiding maps encourage the models to learn representative features of BVs. This is particularly beneficial for computational pathology, where labeled training data is often limited and large models are prone to overfitting. We have quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving segmentation accuracy. In future, we plan to validate this method to segment BVs across various tissue types and investigate the role of cellular structures in relation to BVs in the TME.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISBI 2025</p></details> |

Computational TIL assessment (CTA) has the potential to assist pathologists in this labour-intensive task, but current CTA models rely heavily on many detailed annotations. We propose and validate a fundamentally simpler deep learning based CTA that can be trained in only ten minutes on hundredfold fewer pathologist annotations. We collected whole slide images (WSIs) with TILs scores and clinical data of 2,340 patients with BC from six cohorts including three randomised clinical trials. Morphological features were extracted from whole slide images (WSIs) using a pathology foundation model. Our label-efficient Computational stromal TIL assessment model (ECTIL) directly regresses the TILs score from these features. ECTIL trained on only a few hundred samples (ECTIL-TCGA) showed concordance with the pathologist over five heterogeneous external cohorts (r=0.54-0.74, AUROC=0.80-0.94). Training on all slides of five cohorts (ECTIL-combined) improved results on a held-out test set (r=0.69, AUROC=0.85). Multivariable Cox regression analyses indicated that every 10% increase of ECTIL scores was associated with improved overall survival independent of clinicopathological variables (HR 0.86, p<0.01), similar to the pathologist score (HR 0.87, p<0.001). We demonstrate that ECTIL is highly concordant with an expert pathologist and obtains a similar hazard ratio. ECTIL has a fundamentally simpler design than existing methods and can be trained on orders of magnitude fewer annotations. Such a CTA may be used to pre-screen patients for, e.g., immunotherapy clinical trial inclusion, or as a tool to assist clinicians in the diagnostic work-up of patients with BC.

However, a key limitation of MIL lies in the underexplored potential of pre-training the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches train it from scratch, resulting in performance heavily dependent on the number of labeled WSIs, while overlooking the abundance of unlabeled WSIs available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating HIPT into PreMix achieves an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training datasets and label sizes. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

However, sequencing is costly and delays oncology workflows. Recent advances in Deep Learning allow to predict molecular information from morphological features within Whole Slide Images (WSIs), offering a cost-effective proxy of the molecular markers. While promising, current methods lack the robustness to fully replace direct sequencing. Here we aim to improve existing methods by introducing a model-agnostic framework that allows to inject prior knowledge on gene-gene interactions into Deep Learning architectures, thereby increasing accuracy and robustness. We design the framework to be generic and flexibly adaptable to a wide range of architectures. In a case study on breast cancer, our strategy leads to an average increase of 983 significant genes (out of 25,761) across all 18 experiments, with 14 generalizing to an increase on an independent dataset. Our findings reveal a high potential for injection of prior knowledge to increase gene expression prediction performance from WSIs across a wide range of architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Pre-Trained Feature Extractor Selection in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01167v4)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a preferred method for gigapixel whole slide image (WSI) classification without requiring patch-level annotations. Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset; 2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We hope that these insights can provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of the current SOTA pathology foundation models. Furthermore, this work may inform the development of more effective pathology foundation models.

| **[Scalable Whole Slide Image Representation Using K-Mean Clustering and Fisher Vector Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12085v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution, gigapixel sized images that pose significant computational challenges for traditional machine learning models due to their size and heterogeneity.In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient methodology for WSI classification by leveraging patch-based feature extraction, clustering, and Fisher vector encoding. Initially, WSIs are divided into fixed size patches, and deep feature embeddings are extracted from each patch using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). These patch-level embeddings are subsequently clustered using K-means clustering, where each cluster aggregates semantically similar regions of the WSI. To effectively summarize each cluster, Fisher vector representations are computed by modeling the distribution of patch embeddings in each cluster as a parametric Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The Fisher vectors from each cluster are concatenated into a high-dimensional feature vector, creating a compact and informative representation of the entire WSI. This feature vector is then used by a classifier to predict the WSI's diagnostic label. Our method captures local and global tissue structures and yields robust performance for large-scale WSI classification, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability compared to other approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Keep It Accurate and Robust: An Enhanced Nuclei Analysis Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03415v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation and classification of nuclei in histology images is critical but challenging due to nuclei heterogeneity, staining variations, and tissue complexity. Existing methods often struggle with limited dataset variability, with patches extracted from similar whole slide images (WSI), making models prone to falling into local optima. Here we propose a new framework to address this limitation and enable robust nuclear analysis. Our method leverages dual-level ensemble modeling to overcome issues stemming from limited dataset variation. Intra-ensembling applies diverse transformations to individual samples, while inter-ensembling combines networks of different scales. We also introduce enhancements to the HoVer-Net architecture, including updated encoders, nested dense decoding and model regularization strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks, including 1st place for nuclear composition prediction and 3rd place for segmentation/classification in the 2022 Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting (CoNIC) Challenge. This success validates our approach for accurate histological nuclei analysis. Extensive experiments and ablation studies provide insights into optimal network design choices and training techniques. In conclusion, this work proposes an improved framework advancing the state-of-the-art in nuclei analysis. We release our code and models (https://github.com/WinnieLaugh/CONIC_Pathology_AI) to serve as a toolkit for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask-guided cross-image attention for zero-shot in-silico histopathologic image generation with a diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11664v3)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating in-silico data with generative AI promises a cost-effective alternative to staining, imaging, and annotating whole slide images in computational pathology. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art solution for generating in-silico images, offering unparalleled fidelity and realism. Using appearance transfer diffusion models allows for zero-shot image generation, facilitating fast application and making model training unnecessary. However current appearance transfer diffusion models are designed for natural images, where the main task is to transfer the foreground object from an origin to a target domain, while the background is of insignificant importance. In computational pathology, specifically in oncology, it is however not straightforward to define which objects in an image should be classified as foreground and background, as all objects in an image may be of critical importance for the detailed understanding the tumor micro-environment. We contribute to the applicability of appearance transfer diffusion models to immunohistochemistry-stained images by modifying the appearance transfer guidance to alternate between class-specific AdaIN feature statistics matchings using existing segmentation masks. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the downstream task of supervised epithelium segmentation, showing that the number of manual annotations required for model training can be reduced by 75%, outperforming the baseline approach. Additionally, we consulted with a certified pathologist to investigate future improvements. We anticipate this work to inspire the application of zero-shot diffusion models in computational pathology, providing an efficient method to generate in-silico images with unmatched fidelity and realism, which prove meaningful for downstream tasks, such as training existing deep learning models or finetuning foundation models.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[CellOMaps: A Compact Representation for Robust Classification of Lung Adenocarcinoma Growth Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08094v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a morphologically heterogeneous disease, characterized by five primary histological growth patterns. The classification of such patterns is crucial due to their direct relation to prognosis but the high subjectivity and observer variability pose a major challenge. Although several studies have developed machine learning methods for growth pattern classification, they either only report the predominant pattern per slide or lack proper evaluation. We propose a generalizable machine learning pipeline capable of classifying lung tissue into one of the five patterns or as non-tumor. The proposed pipeline's strength lies in a novel compact Cell Organization Maps (cellOMaps) representation that captures the cellular spatial patterns from Hematoxylin and Eosin whole slide images (WSIs). The proposed pipeline provides state-of-the-art performance on LUAD growth pattern classification when evaluated on both internal unseen slides and external datasets, significantly outperforming the current approaches. In addition, our preliminary results show that the model's outputs can be used to predict patients Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quilt-LLaVA: Visual Instruction Tuning by Extracting Localized Narratives from Open-Source Histopathology Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04746v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosis in histopathology requires a global whole slide images (WSIs) analysis, requiring pathologists to compound evidence from different WSI patches. The gigapixel scale of WSIs poses a challenge for histopathology multi-modal models. Training multi-model models for histopathology requires instruction tuning datasets, which currently contain information for individual image patches, without a spatial grounding of the concepts within each patch and without a wider view of the WSI. Therefore, they lack sufficient diagnostic capacity for histopathology. To bridge this gap, we introduce Quilt-Instruct, a large-scale dataset of 107,131 histopathology-specific instruction question/answer pairs, grounded within diagnostically relevant image patches that make up the WSI. Our dataset is collected by leveraging educational histopathology videos from YouTube, which provides spatial localization of narrations by automatically extracting the narrators' cursor positions. Quilt-Instruct supports contextual reasoning by extracting diagnosis and supporting facts from the entire WSI. Using Quilt-Instruct, we train Quilt-LLaVA, which can reason beyond the given single image patch, enabling diagnostic reasoning across patches. To evaluate Quilt-LLaVA, we propose a comprehensive evaluation dataset created from 985 images and 1283 human-generated question-answers. We also thoroughly evaluate Quilt-LLaVA using public histopathology datasets, where Quilt-LLaVA significantly outperforms SOTA by over 10% on relative GPT-4 score and 4% and 9% on open and closed set VQA. Our code, data, and model are publicly accessible at quilt-llava.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[PySpatial: A High-Speed Whole Slide Image Pathomics Toolkit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06151v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis plays a crucial role in modern digital pathology, enabling large-scale feature extraction from tissue samples. However, traditional feature extraction pipelines based on tools like CellProfiler often involve lengthy workflows, requiring WSI segmentation into patches, feature extraction at the patch level, and subsequent mapping back to the original WSI. To address these challenges, we present PySpatial, a high-speed pathomics toolkit specifically designed for WSI-level analysis. PySpatial streamlines the conventional pipeline by directly operating on computational regions of interest, reducing redundant processing steps. Utilizing rtree-based spatial indexing and matrix-based computation, PySpatial efficiently maps and processes computational regions, significantly accelerating feature extraction while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments on two datasets-Perivascular Epithelioid Cell (PEC) and data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)-demonstrate substantial performance improvements. For smaller and sparse objects in PEC datasets, PySpatial achieves nearly a 10-fold speedup compared to standard CellProfiler pipelines. For larger objects, such as glomeruli and arteries in KPMP datasets, PySpatial achieves a 2-fold speedup. These results highlight PySpatial's potential to handle large-scale WSI analysis with enhanced efficiency and accuracy, paving the way for broader applications in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Our model was trained on a dataset comprising 1.2 million histopathology whole slide images, collected from two medical institutions: Mayo Clinic and Charit\'e - Universt\"atsmedizin Berlin.

Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></details> |  |

However, the black-box nature of these models often limits their clinical adoption. We introduce GRAPHITE (Graph-based Interpretable Tissue Examination), a post-hoc explainable framework designed for breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. GRAPHITE employs a multiscale approach, extracting patches at various magnification levels, constructing an hierarchical graph, and utilising graph attention networks (GAT) with scalewise attention (SAN) to capture scale-dependent features. We trained the model on 140 tumour TMA cores and four benign whole slide images from which 140 benign samples were created, and tested it on 53 pathologist-annotated TMA samples. GRAPHITE outperformed traditional XAI methods, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.56, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, and a threshold robustness (ThR) of 0.70, indicating that the model maintains high performance across a wide range of thresholds. In clinical utility, GRAPHITE achieved the highest area under the decision curve (AUDC) of 4.17e+5, indicating reliable decision support across thresholds. These results highlight GRAPHITE's potential as a clinically valuable tool in computational pathology, providing interpretable visualisations that align with the pathologists' diagnostic reasoning and support precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Figures, 1 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Label-free Concept Based Multiple Instance Learning for Gigapixel Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02922v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods allow for gigapixel Whole-Slide Image (WSI) analysis with only slide-level annotations. Interpretability is crucial for safely deploying such algorithms in high-stakes medical domains. Traditional MIL methods offer explanations by highlighting salient regions. However, such spatial heatmaps provide limited insights for end users. To address this, we propose a novel inherently interpretable WSI-classification approach that uses human-understandable pathology concepts to generate explanations. Our proposed Concept MIL model leverages recent advances in vision-language models to directly predict pathology concepts based on image features. The model's predictions are obtained through a linear combination of the concepts identified on the top-K patches of a WSI, enabling inherent explanations by tracing each concept's influence on the prediction. In contrast to traditional concept-based interpretable models, our approach eliminates the need for costly human annotations by leveraging the vision-language model. We validate our method on two widely used pathology datasets: Camelyon16 and PANDA. On both datasets, Concept MIL achieves AUC and accuracy scores over 0.9, putting it on par with state-of-the-art models. We further find that 87.1\% (Camelyon16) and 85.3\% (PANDA) of the top 20 patches fall within the tumor region. A user study shows that the concepts identified by our model align with the concepts used by pathologists, making it a promising strategy for human-interpretable WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often rely on limited data modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Cross-modal Fusion Network (ICFNet) that integrates histopathology whole slide images, genomic expression profiles, patient demographics, and treatment protocols. Specifically, three types of encoders, a residual orthogonal decomposition module and a unification fusion module are employed to merge multi-modal features to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, a balanced negative log-likelihood loss function is designed to ensure fair training across different patients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ICFNet outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on five public TCGA datasets, including BLCA, BRCA, GBMLGG, LUAD, and UCEC, and shows its potential to support clinical decision-making and advance precision medicine.

However, manual assessments are subjective and prone to variability. In response, we introduce FDDM, a novel framework bridging the gap between patch classification and region-based segmentation. FDDM operates in two stages: patch-based classification, followed by region-based refinement, enabling cross-patch information intergation. Leveraging a newly curated dataset of osteosarcoma images, FDDM demonstrates superior segmentation performance, achieving up to a 10% improvement mIOU and a 32.12% enhancement in necrosis rate estimation over state-of-the-art methods. This framework sets a new benchmark in osteosarcoma assessment, highlighting the potential of foundation models and diffusion-based refinements in complex medical imaging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

RL2 leverages ResNet features with a normalizing flow to calculate RMSE distance in the latent space, providing reliable assessments across diverse histopathology datasets. We evaluated the performance of RL2 on degradation types, such as blur, Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and rectangular patches, as well as diffusion processes. RL2's monotonic response to increasing degradation makes it well-suited for models that assess image quality, proving a valuable advancement for evaluating image generation techniques in histopathology. It can also be used to discard low-quality patches while sampling from a whole slide image. It is also significantly lighter and faster compared to traditional metrics and requires fewer images to give stable metric value.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Fast TILs -- A Pipeline for Efficient TILs Estimation in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02913v2)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing the critical need for accurate prognostic biomarkers in cancer treatment, quantifying tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents considerable challenges. Manual TIL quantification in whole slide images (WSIs) is laborious and subject to variability, potentially undermining patient outcomes. Our study introduces an automated pipeline that utilizes semi-stochastic patch sampling, patch classification to retain prognostically relevant patches, and cell quantification using the HoVer-Net model to streamline the TIL evaluation process. This pipeline efficiently excludes approximately 70% of areas not relevant for prognosis and requires only 5% of the remaining patches to maintain prognostic accuracy (c-index = 0.65). The computational efficiency achieved does not sacrifice prognostic accuracy, as demonstrated by the TILs score's strong association with patient survival, which outperforms traditional CD8 IHC scoring methods. While the pipeline demonstrates potential for enhancing NSCLC prognostication and personalization of treatment, comprehensive clinical validation is still required. Future research should focus on verifying its broader clinical utility and investigating additional biomarkers to improve NSCLC prognosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 7 appendix pages</p></details> |

Current digital pathology AI models lack systematic solutions to address trustworthiness concerns arising from model limitations and data discrepancies between model deployment and development environments. To address this issue, we developed TRUECAM, a framework designed to ensure both data and model trustworthiness in non-small cell lung cancer subtyping with whole-slide images. TRUECAM integrates 1) a spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process for identifying out-of-scope inputs and 2) an ambiguity-guided elimination of tiles to filter out highly ambiguous regions, addressing data trustworthiness, as well as 3) conformal prediction to ensure controlled error rates. We systematically evaluated the framework across multiple large-scale cancer datasets, leveraging both task-specific and foundation models, illustrate that an AI model wrapped with TRUECAM significantly outperforms models that lack such guidance, in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency, while also achieving improvements in fairness. These findings highlight TRUECAM as a versatile wrapper framework for digital pathology AI models with diverse architectural designs, promoting their responsible and effective applications in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning with Vision-Language Models for Incremental Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10573v3)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has very significant applications in clinical pathology, e.g., tumor identification and cancer diagnosis. Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches: one is for generating bag-level features by prototype-guided aggregation of instance features, while the other is for enhancing class features through a combination of class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four public WSI datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

| **[From Histopathology Images to Cell Clouds: Learning Slide Representations with Hierarchical Cell Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16715v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is clinically crucial and potentially very beneficial to be able to analyze and model directly the spatial distributions of cells in histopathology whole slide images (WSI). However, most existing WSI datasets lack cell-level annotations, owing to the extremely high cost over giga-pixel images. Thus, it remains an open question whether deep learning models can directly and effectively analyze WSIs from the semantic aspect of cell distributions. In this work, we construct a large-scale WSI dataset with more than 5 billion cell-level annotations, termed WSI-Cell5B, and a novel hierarchical Cell Cloud Transformer (CCFormer) to tackle these challenges. WSI-Cell5B is based on 6,998 WSIs of 11 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program, and all WSIs are annotated per cell by coordinates and types. To the best of our knowledge, WSI-Cell5B is the first WSI-level large-scale dataset integrating cell-level annotations. On the other hand, CCFormer formulates the collection of cells in each WSI as a cell cloud and models cell spatial distribution. Specifically, Neighboring Information Embedding (NIE) is proposed to characterize the distribution of cells within the neighborhood of each cell, and a novel Hierarchical Spatial Perception (HSP) module is proposed to learn the spatial relationship among cells in a bottom-up manner. The clinical analysis indicates that WSI-Cell5B can be used to design clinical evaluation metrics based on counting cells that effectively assess the survival risk of patients. Extensive experiments on survival prediction and cancer staging show that learning from cell spatial distribution alone can already achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, i.e., CCFormer strongly outperforms other competing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the large size and complexity of WSIs may pose significant challenges for deep learning models, in both computational efficiency and effective representation learning. In this work, we introduce Pixel-Mamba, a novel deep learning architecture designed to efficiently handle gigapixel WSIs. Pixel-Mamba leverages the Mamba module, a state-space model (SSM) with linear memory complexity, and incorporates local inductive biases through progressively expanding tokens, akin to convolutional neural networks. This enables Pixel-Mamba to hierarchically combine both local and global information while efficiently addressing computational challenges. Remarkably, Pixel-Mamba achieves or even surpasses the quantitative performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models that were pretrained on millions of WSIs or WSI-text pairs, in a range of tumor staging and survival analysis tasks, {\bf even without requiring any pathology-specific pretraining}. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Pixel-Mamba as a powerful and efficient framework for end-to-end WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |

| **[Promptable Representation Distribution Learning and Data Augmentation for Gigapixel Histopathology WSI Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14473v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gigapixel image analysis, particularly for whole slide images (WSIs), often relies on multiple instance learning (MIL). Under the paradigm of MIL, patch image representations are extracted and then fixed during the training of the MIL classifiers for efficiency consideration. However, the invariance of representations makes it difficult to perform data augmentation for WSI-level model training, which significantly limits the performance of the downstream WSI analysis. The current data augmentation methods for gigapixel images either introduce additional computational costs or result in a loss of semantic information, which is hard to meet the requirements for efficiency and stability needed for WSI model training. In this paper, we propose a Promptable Representation Distribution Learning framework (PRDL) for both patch-level representation learning and WSI-level data augmentation. Meanwhile, we explore the use of prompts to guide data augmentation in feature space, which achieves promptable data augmentation for training robust WSI-level models. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method stably outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Diagnosising Helicobacter pylori using AutoEncoders and Limited Annotations through Anomalous Staining Patterns in IHC Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13857v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: This work addresses the detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in histological images with immunohistochemical staining. This analysis is a time demanding task, currently done by an expert pathologist that visually inspects the samples. Given the effort required to localise the pathogen in images, a limited number of annotations might be available in an initial setting. Our goal is to design an approach that, using a limited set of annotations, is capable of obtaining results good enough to be used as a support tool. Methods: We propose to use autoencoders to learn the latent patterns of healthy patches and formulate a specific measure of the reconstruction error of the image in HSV space. ROC analysis is used to set the optimal threshold of this measure and the percentage of positive patches in a sample that determines the presence of H. pylori. Results: Our method has been tested on an own database of 245 Whole Slide Images (WSI) having 117 cases without H. pylori and different density of the bacteria in the remaining ones. The database has 1211 annotated patches, with only 163 positive patches. This dataset of positive annotations was used to train a baseline thresholding and an SVM using the features of a pre-trained RedNet18 and ViT models. A 10-fold cross-validation shows that our method has better performance with 91% accuracy, 86% sensitivity, 96% specificity and 0.97 AUC in the diagnosis of H. pylori. Conclusion: Unlike classification approaches, our shallow autoencoder with threshold adaptation for the detection of anomalous staining is able to achieve competitive results with a limited set of annotated data. This initial approach is good enough to be used as a guide for fast annotation of infected patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advances in Kidney Biopsy Lesion Assessment through Dense Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17166v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renal biopsies are the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. Lesion scores made by renal pathologists are semi-quantitative and exhibit high inter-observer variability. Automating lesion classification within segmented anatomical structures can provide decision support in quantification analysis, thereby reducing inter-observer variability. Nevertheless, classifying lesions in regions-of-interest (ROIs) is clinically challenging due to (a) a large amount of densely packed anatomical objects, (b) class imbalance across different compartments (at least 3), (c) significant variation in size and shape of anatomical objects and (d) the presence of multi-label lesions per anatomical structure. Existing models cannot address these complexities in an efficient and generic manner. This paper presents an analysis for a \textbf{generalized solution} to datasets from various sources (pathology departments) with different types of lesions. Our approach utilizes two sub-networks: dense instance segmentation and lesion classification. We introduce \textbf{DiffRegFormer}, an end-to-end dense instance segmentation sub-network designed for multi-class, multi-scale objects within ROIs. Combining diffusion models, transformers, and RCNNs, DiffRegFormer {is a computational-friendly framework that can efficiently recognize over 500 objects across three anatomical classes, i.e., glomeruli, tubuli, and arteries, within ROIs.} In a dataset of 303 ROIs from 148 Jones' silver-stained renal Whole Slide Images (WSIs), our approach outperforms previous methods, achieving an Average Precision of 52.1\% (detection) and 46.8\% (segmentation). Moreover, our lesion classification sub-network achieves 89.2\% precision and 64.6\% recall on 21889 object patches out of the 303 ROIs. Lastly, our model demonstrates direct domain transfer to PAS-stained renal WSIs without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Potential of Digital Pathology: Novel Baselines for Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13137v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology offers a groundbreaking opportunity to transform clinical practice in histopathological image analysis, yet faces a significant hurdle: the substantial file sizes of pathological Whole Slide Images (WSI). While current digital pathology solutions rely on lossy JPEG compression to address this issue, lossy compression can introduce color and texture disparities, potentially impacting clinical decision-making. While prior research addresses perceptual image quality and downstream performance independently of each other, we jointly evaluate compression schemes for perceptual and downstream task quality on four different datasets. In addition, we collect an initially uncompressed dataset for an unbiased perceptual evaluation of compression schemes. Our results show that deep learning models fine-tuned for perceptual quality outperform conventional compression schemes like JPEG-XL or WebP for further compression of WSI. However, they exhibit a significant bias towards the compression artifacts present in the training data and struggle to generalize across various compression schemes. We introduce a novel evaluation metric based on feature similarity between original files and compressed files that aligns very well with the actual downstream performance on the compressed WSI. Our metric allows for a general and standardized evaluation of lossy compression schemes and mitigates the requirement to independently assess different downstream tasks. Our study provides novel insights for the assessment of lossy compression schemes for WSI and encourages a unified evaluation of lossy compression schemes to accelerate the clinical uptake of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Knowledge-enhanced Pathology Vision-language Foundation Model for Cancer Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13126v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has enabled the development of highly robust foundation models for various pathological tasks across diverse diseases and patient cohorts. Among these models, vision-language pre-training, which leverages large-scale paired data to align pathology image and text embedding spaces, and provides a novel zero-shot paradigm for downstream tasks. However, existing models have been primarily data-driven and lack the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, which limits their performance in cancer diagnosis, especially for rare tumor subtypes. To address this limitation, we establish a Knowledge-enhanced Pathology (KEEP) foundation model that harnesses disease knowledge to facilitate vision-language pre-training. Specifically, we first construct a disease knowledge graph (KG) that covers 11,454 human diseases with 139,143 disease attributes, including synonyms, definitions, and hypernym relations. We then systematically reorganize the millions of publicly available noisy pathology image-text pairs, into 143K well-structured semantic groups linked through the hierarchical relations of the disease KG. To derive more nuanced image and text representations, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced vision-language pre-training approach that integrates disease knowledge into the alignment within hierarchical semantic groups instead of unstructured image-text pairs. Validated on 18 diverse benchmarks with more than 14,000 whole slide images (WSIs), KEEP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot cancer diagnostic tasks. Notably, for cancer detection, KEEP demonstrates an average sensitivity of 89.8% at a specificity of 95.0% across 7 cancer types. For cancer subtyping, KEEP achieves a median balanced accuracy of 0.456 in subtyping 30 rare brain cancers, indicating strong generalizability for diagnosing rare tumors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Embedding Aggregation Methods in Computational Pathology: A Clinical Data Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07841v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular self-supervised learning of foundation models (FMs), are revolutionizing medical imaging and computational pathology (CPath). A constant challenge in the analysis of digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is the problem of aggregating tens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings to a slide-level representation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for genomic research, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of these techniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequately explored. This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of ten slide-level aggregation techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks, including diagnostic assessment, biomarker classification, and outcome prediction. The results yield following key insights: (1) Embeddings derived from domain-specific (histological images) FMs outperform those from generic ImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware aggregators enhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained models but not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks and spatially-aware models do not show general superiority as it would be expected. These findings underscore the need for more adaptable and universally applicable aggregation techniques, guiding future research towards tools that better meet the evolving needs of clinical-AI in pathology.

Previous research has primarily focused on separately training patch-level and whole-slide image (WSI)-level models, limiting the integration of learned knowledge across patches and WSIs, and resulting in redundant models. In this work, we introduce CPath-Omni, the first 15-billion-parameter LMM designed to unify both patch and WSI level image analysis, consolidating a variety of tasks at both levels, including classification, visual question answering, captioning, and visual referring prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPath-Omni achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across seven diverse tasks on 39 out of 42 datasets, outperforming or matching task-specific models trained for individual tasks. Additionally, we develop a specialized pathology CLIP-based visual processor for CPath-Omni, CPath-CLIP, which, for the first time, integrates different vision models and incorporates a large language model as a text encoder to build a more powerful CLIP model, which achieves SOTA performance on nine zero-shot and four few-shot datasets. Our findings highlight CPath-Omni's ability to unify diverse pathology tasks, demonstrating its potential to streamline and advance the field of foundation model in pathology.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

However, the invariance of these representations to patch rotation remains unexplored. This study investigates the rotational invariance of latent representations across twelve foundation models by quantifying the alignment between non-rotated and rotated patches using mutual $k$-nearest neighbours and cosine distance. Models that incorporated rotation augmentation during self-supervised training exhibited significantly greater invariance to rotations. We hypothesise that the absence of rotational inductive bias in the transformer architecture necessitates rotation augmentation during training to achieve learned invariance.

This approach leads to slide representations highly tailored to a specific clinical task. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.5% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors. Code available at https://github.com/KatherLab/COBRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[HMIL: Hierarchical Multi-Instance Learning for Fine-Grained Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07660v2)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained classification of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential in precision oncology, enabling precise cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. The core of this task involves distinguishing subtle morphological variations within the same broad category of gigapixel-resolution images, which presents a significant challenge. While the multi-instance learning (MIL) paradigm alleviates the computational burden of WSIs, existing MIL methods often overlook hierarchical label correlations, treating fine-grained classification as a flat multi-class classification task. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel hierarchical multi-instance learning (HMIL) framework. By facilitating on the hierarchical alignment of inherent relationships between different hierarchy of labels at instance and bag level, our approach provides a more structured and informative learning process. Specifically, HMIL incorporates a class-wise attention mechanism that aligns hierarchical information at both the instance and bag levels. Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability for fine-grained classification and a curriculum-based dynamic weighting module to adaptively balance the hierarchical feature during training. Extensive experiments on our large-scale cytology cervical cancer (CCC) dataset and two public histology datasets, BRACS and PANDA, demonstrate the state-of-the-art class-wise and overall performance of our HMIL framework.

However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block Dual Fusion of Whole Slide Images and Omics Data for Precision Oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17418v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of DNA methylation data with a Whole Slide Image (WSI) offers significant potential for enhancing the diagnostic precision of central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification in neuropathology. While existing approaches typically integrate encoded omic data with histology at either an early or late fusion stage, the potential of reintroducing omic data through dual fusion remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose the use of omic embeddings during early and late fusion to capture complementary information from local (patch-level) to global (slide-level) interactions, boosting performance through multimodal integration. In the early fusion stage, omic embeddings are projected onto WSI patches in latent-space, which generates embeddings that encapsulate per-patch molecular and morphological insights. This effectively incorporates omic information into the spatial representation of the WSI. These embeddings are then refined with a Multiple Instance Learning gated attention mechanism which attends to diagnostic patches. In the late fusion stage, we reintroduce the omic data by fusing it with slide-level omic-WSI embeddings using a Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB), which richly intermingles features from both modalities, capturing their correlations and complementarity. We demonstrate accurate CNS tumor subtyping across 20 fine-grained subtypes and validate our approach on benchmark datasets, achieving improved survival prediction on TCGA-BLCA and competitive performance on TCGA-BRCA compared to state-of-the-art methods. This dual fusion strategy enhances interpretability and classification performance, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised to 10 pages, with corrected typos, updated references (some added, others removed), improved figure quality, modified text for better method validation, added one more co-author, and identified the IEEE member</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 35 tables</p></details> |
| **[A multimodal ensemble approach for clear cell renal cell carcinoma treatment outcome prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07136v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: A reliable cancer prognosis model for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) can enhance personalized treatment. We developed a multi-modal ensemble model (MMEM) that integrates pretreatment clinical data, multi-omics data, and histopathology whole slide image (WSI) data to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for ccRCC patients. Methods: We analyzed 226 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC) dataset, which includes OS, DFS follow-up data, and five data modalities: clinical data, WSIs, and three multi-omics datasets (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation). Separate survival models were built for OS and DFS. Cox-proportional hazards (CPH) model with forward feature selection is used for clinical and multi-omics data. Features from WSIs were extracted using ResNet and three general-purpose foundation models. A deep learning-based CPH model predicted survival using encoded WSI features. Risk scores from all models were combined based on training performance. Results: Performance was assessed using concordance index (C-index) and AUROC. The clinical feature-based CPH model received the highest weight for both OS and DFS tasks. Among WSI-based models, the general-purpose foundation model (UNI) achieved the best performance. The final MMEM model surpassed single-modality models, achieving C-indices of 0.820 (OS) and 0.833 (DFS), and AUROC values of 0.831 (3-year patient death) and 0.862 (cancer recurrence). Using predicted risk medians to stratify high- and low-risk groups, log-rank tests showed improved performance in both OS and DFS compared to single-modality models. Conclusion: MMEM is the first multi-modal model for ccRCC patients, integrating five data modalities. It outperformed single-modality models in prognostic ability and has the potential to assist in ccRCC patient management if independently validated.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[GCUNet: A GNN-Based Contextual Learning Network for Tertiary Lymphoid Structure Semantic Segmentation in Whole Slide Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06129v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) semantic segmentation in whole slide image (WSI). Unlike TLS binary segmentation, TLS semantic segmentation identifies boundaries and maturity, which requires integrating contextual information to discover discriminative features. Due to the extensive scale of WSI (e.g., 100,000 \times 100,000 pixels), the segmentation of TLS is usually carried out through a patch-based strategy. However, this prevents the model from accessing information outside of the patches, limiting the performance. To address this issue, we propose GCUNet, a GNN-based contextual learning network for TLS semantic segmentation. Given an image patch (target) to be segmented, GCUNet first progressively aggregates long-range and fine-grained context outside the target. Then, a Detail and Context Fusion block (DCFusion) is designed to integrate the context and detail of the target to predict the segmentation mask. We build four TLS semantic segmentation datasets, called TCGA-COAD, TCGA-LUSC, TCGA-BLCA and INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former three datasets (comprising 826 WSIs and 15,276 TLSs) publicly available to promote the TLS semantic segmentation. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCUNet, achieving at least 7.41% improvement in mF1 compared with SOTA.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, deploying an ensemble of digital pathology foundation models yields higher baseline accuracy, although the benefits appear to diminish with more complex MIL architectures.

In particular, our method adds a training constraint to the supervised contrastive learning approach to achieve domain adaptation and improve inter-class separability. Experiments performed on domain adaptation and classification of whole-slide images of six skin cancer subtypes from two centers demonstrate the method's usefulness. The results reflect superior performance compared to not using domain adaptation after feature extraction or staining normalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CASEIB 2024</p></details> |

Currently, however, most deep learning-based ST analyses are limited to two-dimensional (2D) sections, which can introduce diagnostic errors due to the heterogeneity of pathological tissues across 3D sections. Expanding ST to three-dimensional (3D) volumes is challenging due to the prohibitive costs; a 2D ST acquisition already costs over 50 times more than whole slide imaging (WSI), and a full 3D volume with 10 sections can be an order of magnitude more expensive. To reduce costs, scientists have attempted to predict ST data directly from WSI without performing actual ST acquisition. However, these methods typically yield unsatisfying results. To address this, we introduce a novel problem setting: 3D ST imputation using 3D WSI histology sections combined with a single 2D ST slide. To do so, we present the Anatomy-aware Spatial Imputation Graph Network (ASIGN) for more precise, yet affordable, 3D ST modeling. The ASIGN architecture extends existing 2D spatial relationships into 3D by leveraging cross-layer overlap and similarity-based expansion. Moreover, a multi-level spatial attention graph network integrates features comprehensively across different data sources. We evaluated ASIGN on three public spatial transcriptomics datasets, with experimental results demonstrating that ASIGN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D scenarios.

Nevertheless, existing methods have not fully utilized the inherent hierarchical structure within both whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic data, from which better intra-modal representations and inter-modal integration could be derived. Moreover, many existing studies attempt to improve multi-modal representations through attention mechanisms, which inevitably lead to high complexity when processing high-dimensional WSIs and transcriptomic data. Recently, a structured state space model named Mamba emerged as a promising approach for its superior performance in modeling long sequences with low complexity. In this study, we propose Mamba with multi-grained multi-modal interaction (SurvMamba) for survival prediction. SurvMamba is implemented with a Hierarchical Interaction Mamba (HIM) module that facilitates efficient intra-modal interactions at different granularities, thereby capturing more detailed local features as well as rich global representations. In addition, an Interaction Fusion Mamba (IFM) module is used for cascaded inter-modal interactive fusion, yielding more comprehensive features for survival prediction. Comprehensive evaluations on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that SurvMamba outperforms other existing methods in terms of performance and computational cost.</p></details> |  |

This opens up new possibilities for enhancing whole slide image (WSI) prediction tasks with localized gene expression. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage the interactions between different tissue locations, which are crucial for accurate joint prediction. To address this, we introduce MERGE (Multi-faceted hiErarchical gRaph for Gene Expressions), which combines a multi-faceted hierarchical graph construction strategy with graph neural networks (GNN) to improve gene expression predictions from WSIs. By clustering tissue image patches based on both spatial and morphological features, and incorporating intra- and inter-cluster edges, our approach fosters interactions between distant tissue locations during GNN learning. As an additional contribution, we evaluate different data smoothing techniques that are necessary to mitigate artifacts in ST data, often caused by technical imperfections. We advocate for adopting gene-aware smoothing methods that are more biologically justified. Experimental results on gene expression prediction show that our GNN method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper: 8 pages, Supplementary Material: 9 pages, Figures: 16</p></details> |

Since differentiation of cancer sub-types is important for treatment and current, manual methods are time consuming and subjective, automatic computer-aided differentiation of cancer types is crucial. Manual differentiation of thyroid cancer is based on tissue sections, analysed by pathologists using histological features. Due to the enormous size of gigapixel whole slide images, holistic classification using deep learning methods is not feasible. Patch based multiple instance learning approaches, combined with aggregations such as bag-of-words, is a common approach. This work's contribution is to extend a patch based state-of-the-art method by generating and combining feature vectors of three different patch resolutions and analysing three distinct ways of combining them. The results showed improvements in one of the three multi-scale approaches, while the others led to decreased scores.

Transformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to their quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently, Mamba introduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high parallelism, enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D sequences. However, extending Mamba to vision tasks, which inherently involve 2D structures, results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D sequence processing. On the other hand, current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D structures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack of efficient parallel algorithms. In this work, we propose 2DMamba, a novel 2D selective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images into Mamba, with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator, adopting both spatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of our approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that 2DMamba~improves up to $2.48\%$ in AUC, $3.11\%$ in F1 score, $2.47\%$ in accuracy and $5.52\%$ in C-index. Additionally, integrating our method with VMamba for natural imaging yields $0.5$ to $0.7$ improvements in mIoU on the ADE20k semantic segmentation dataset, and $0.2\%$ accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K classification dataset.

However, current approaches predominantly rely on visual-language models, which may impose limitations from a molecular perspective and lead to performance bottlenecks. Here, we introduce a Unified Molecule-enhanced Pathology Image REpresentationn Learning framework (UMPIRE). UMPIRE aims to leverage complementary information from gene expression profiles to guide the multimodal pre-training, enhancing the molecular awareness of pathology image representation learning. We demonstrate that this molecular perspective provides a robust, task-agnostic training signal for learning pathology image embeddings. Due to the scarcity of paired data, approximately 4 million entries of spatial transcriptomics gene expression were collected to train the gene encoder. By leveraging powerful pre-trained encoders, UMPIRE aligns the encoders across over 697K pathology image-gene expression pairs. The performance of UMPIRE is demonstrated across various molecular-related downstream tasks, including gene expression prediction, spot classification, and mutation state prediction in whole slide images. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and open new avenues for exploring computational pathology enhanced by molecular perspectives.

In traditional bounding box-based object detection, combining results from multiple models improves accuracy, especially when real-time processing isn't crucial. Unfortunately, this widely adopted strategy is not readily available for combining circle representations. In this paper, we propose Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), a simple approach for merging predictions from various circle detection models. Our method leverages confidence scores associated with each proposed bounding circle to generate averaged circles. We evaluate our method on a proprietary dataset for glomerular detection in whole slide imaging (WSI) and find a performance gain of 5% compared to existing ensemble methods. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of two annotation methods, fully manual annotation and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach, in labeling 200,000 glomeruli. The HITL approach, which integrates machine learning detection with human verification, demonstrated remarkable improvements in annotation efficiency. The Weighted Circle Fusion technique not only enhances object detection precision but also notably reduces false detections, presenting a promising direction for future research and application in pathological image analysis.

However, existing open-source tools are often distributed as source code or Docker containers, requiring advanced programming skills that hinder accessibility for non-programmers, such as clinicians. Additionally, current models are typically trained on a single dataset and lack flexibility in adjusting confidence levels for predictions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GloFinder, a QuPath plugin designed for single-click automated glomeruli detection across entire WSIs with online editing through the graphical user interface (GUI). GloFinder employs CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework utilizing circle representations for precise object localization, with models trained on approximately 160,000 manually annotated glomeruli. To further enhance accuracy, the plugin incorporates Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), an ensemble method that combines confidence scores from multiple CircleNet models to produce refined predictions, achieving superior performance in glomerular detection.

In contrast, whole-slide hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histological images are readily accessible and allow for detailed examinations of tissue structure and composition at the microscopic level. Recent advancements have utilized these histological images to predict spatially resolved gene expression profiles. However, state-of-the-art works treat gene expression prediction as a multi-output regression problem, where each gene is learned independently with its own weights, failing to capture the shared dependencies and co-expression patterns between genes. Besides, existing works can only predict gene expression values for genes seen during training, limiting their ability to generalize to new, unseen genes. To address the above limitations, this paper presents GeneQuery, which aims to solve this gene expression prediction task in a question-answering (QA) manner for better generality and flexibility. Specifically, GeneQuery takes gene-related texts as queries and whole-slide images as contexts and then predicts the queried gene expression values. With such a transformation, GeneQuery can implicitly estimate the gene distribution by introducing the gene random variable. Besides, the proposed GeneQuery consists of two architecture implementations, i.e., spot-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between images and gene-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between genes. Comprehensive experiments on spatial transcriptomics datasets show that the proposed GeneQuery outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on known and unseen genes. More results also demonstrate that GeneQuery can potentially analyze the tissue structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[PATHS: A Hierarchical Transformer for Efficient Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18225v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational analysis of whole slide images (WSIs) has seen significant research progress in recent years, with applications ranging across important diagnostic and prognostic tasks such as survival or cancer subtype prediction. Many state-of-the-art models process the entire slide - which may be as large as $150,000 \times 150,000$ pixels - as a bag of many patches, the size of which necessitates computationally cheap feature aggregation methods. However, a large proportion of these patches are uninformative, such as those containing only healthy or adipose tissue, adding significant noise and size to the bag. We propose Pathology Transformer with Hierarchical Selection (PATHS), a novel top-down method for hierarchical weakly supervised representation learning on slide-level tasks in computational pathology. PATHS is inspired by the cross-magnification manner in which a human pathologist examines a slide, recursively filtering patches at each magnification level to a small subset relevant to the diagnosis. Our method overcomes the complications of processing the entire slide, enabling quadratic self-attention and providing a simple interpretable measure of region importance. We apply PATHS to five datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and achieve superior performance on slide-level prediction tasks when compared to previous methods, despite processing only a small proportion of the slide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Knowledge Concepts to Whole Slide Images for Precise Histopathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18101v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the large size and lack of fine-grained annotation, Whole Slide Images (WSIs) analysis is commonly approached as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, previous studies only learn from training data, posing a stark contrast to how human clinicians teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities and factors. Here we present a novel knowledge concept-based MIL framework, named ConcepPath to fill this gap. Specifically, ConcepPath utilizes GPT-4 to induce reliable diseasespecific human expert concepts from medical literature, and incorporate them with a group of purely learnable concepts to extract complementary knowledge from training data. In ConcepPath, WSIs are aligned to these linguistic knowledge concepts by utilizing pathology vision-language model as the basic building component. In the application of lung cancer subtyping, breast cancer HER2 scoring, and gastric cancer immunotherapy-sensitive subtyping task, ConcepPath significantly outperformed previous SOTA methods which lack the guidance of human expert knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Our study shows that using fixed hyper-parameters for pre-processing out-of-domain WSIs can significantly degrade performance. Therefore, it is critical to search domain-specific hyper-parameters during inference. However, searching for an optimal parameter set is time-consuming. To overcome this, we propose BAHOP, a novel Similarity-based Basin Hopping optimization for fast parameter tuning to enhance inference performance on out-of-domain data. The proposed BAHOP achieves 5\% to 30\% improvement in accuracy with $\times5$ times faster on average.</p></details> |  |

Our group previously developed the Glo-In-One toolkit for integrated detection and segmentation of glomeruli. In this study, we leverage the Glo-In-One toolkit to version 2 with fine-grained segmentation capabilities, curating 14 distinct labels for tissue regions, cells, and lesions across a dataset of 23,529 annotated glomeruli across human and mouse histopathology data. To our knowledge, this dataset is among the largest of its kind to date.In this study, we present a single dynamic head deep learning architecture designed to segment 14 classes within partially labeled images of human and mouse pathology data. Our model was trained using a training set derived from 368 annotated kidney whole-slide images (WSIs) to identify 5 key intraglomerular tissues covering Bowman's capsule, glomerular tuft, mesangium, mesangial cells, and podocytes. Additionally, the network segments 9 glomerular lesion classes including adhesion, capsular drop, global sclerosis, hyalinosis, mesangial lysis, microaneurysm, nodular sclerosis, mesangial expansion, and segmental sclerosis. The glomerulus segmentation model achieved a decent performance compared with baselines, and achieved a 76.5 % average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Additional, transfer learning from rodent to human for glomerular lesion segmentation model has enhanced the average segmentation accuracy across different types of lesions by more than 3 %, as measured by Dice scores. The Glo-In-One-v2 model and trained weight have been made publicly available at https: //github.com/hrlblab/Glo-In-One_v2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-organ Deployment of EOS Detection AI without Retraining: Feasibility and Limitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15942v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by persistent inflammation in the paranasal sinuses, leading to typical symptoms of nasal congestion, facial pressure, olfactory dysfunction, and discolored nasal drainage, which can significantly impact quality-of-life. Eosinophils (Eos), a crucial component in the mucosal immune response, have been linked to disease severity in CRS. The diagnosis of eosinophilic CRS typically uses a threshold of 10-20 eos per high-power field (HPF). However, manually counting Eos in histological samples is laborious and time-intensive, making the use of AI-driven methods for automated evaluations highly desirable. Interestingly, eosinophils are predominantly located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which has prompted the release of numerous deep learning models trained on GI data. This study leverages a CircleSnake model initially trained on upper-GI data to segment Eos cells in whole slide images (WSIs) of nasal tissues. It aims to determine the extent to which Eos segmentation models developed for the GI tract can be adapted to nasal applications without retraining. The experimental results show promising accuracy in some WSIs, although, unsurprisingly, the performance varies across cases. This paper details these performance outcomes, delves into the reasons for such variations, and aims to provide insights that could guide future development of deep learning models for eosinophilic CRS.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[FOCUS: Knowledge-enhanced Adaptive Visual Compression for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14743v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot learning presents a critical solution for cancer diagnosis in computational pathology (CPath), addressing fundamental limitations in data availability, particularly the scarcity of expert annotations and patient privacy constraints. A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dddavid4real/FOCUS.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Stain-Invariant Representation for Tissue Classification in Histology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15237v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of digitising histology slides involves multiple factors that can affect a whole slide image's (WSI) final appearance, including the staining protocol, scanner, and tissue type. This variability constitutes a domain shift and results in significant problems when training and testing deep learning (DL) algorithms in multi-cohort settings. As such, developing robust and generalisable DL models in computational pathology (CPath) remains an open challenge. In this regard, we propose a framework that generates stain-augmented versions of the training images using stain matrix perturbation. Thereafter, we employed a stain regularisation loss to enforce consistency between the feature representations of the source and augmented images. Doing so encourages the model to learn stain-invariant and, consequently, domain-invariant feature representations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on cross-domain multi-class tissue type classification of colorectal cancer images and have achieved improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Attention Model with Reinforcement Learning for Classification of Histology Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09682v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital whole slide images (WSIs) are generally captured at microscopic resolution and encompass extensive spatial data. Directly feeding these images to deep learning models is computationally intractable due to memory constraints, while downsampling the WSIs risks incurring information loss. Alternatively, splitting the WSIs into smaller patches may result in a loss of important contextual information. In this paper, we propose a novel dual attention approach, consisting of two main components, both inspired by the visual examination process of a pathologist: The first soft attention model processes a low magnification view of the WSI to identify relevant regions of interest, followed by a custom sampling method to extract diverse and spatially distinct image tiles from the selected ROIs. The second component, the hard attention classification model further extracts a sequence of multi-resolution glimpses from each tile for classification. Since hard attention is non-differentiable, we train this component using reinforcement learning to predict the location of the glimpses. This approach allows the model to focus on essential regions instead of processing the entire tile, thereby aligning with a pathologist's way of diagnosis. The two components are trained in an end-to-end fashion using a joint loss function to demonstrate the efficacy of the model. The proposed model was evaluated on two WSI-level classification problems: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 scoring on breast cancer histology images and prediction of Intact/Loss status of two Mismatch Repair biomarkers from colorectal cancer histology images. We show that the proposed model achieves performance better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods while processing less than 10% of the WSI at the highest magnification and reducing the time required to infer the WSI-level label by more than 75%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Domain Adaptation with Dual-branch Encoder and Two-level Alignment for Whole Slide Image-based Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14001v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, histopathological whole slide image (WSI)- based survival analysis has attracted much attention in medical image analysis. In practice, WSIs usually come from different hospitals or laboratories, which can be seen as different domains, and thus may have significant differences in imaging equipment, processing procedures, and sample sources. These differences generally result in large gaps in distribution between different WSI domains, and thus the survival analysis models trained on one domain may fail to transfer to another. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-branch Encoder and Two-level Alignment (DETA) framework to explore both feature and category-level alignment between different WSI domains. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as graph domain adaptation (GDA) by virtue the graph representation of WSIs. Then we construct a dual-branch graph encoder, including the message passing branch and the shortest path branch, to explicitly and implicitly extract semantic information from the graph-represented WSIs. To realize GDA, we propose a two-level alignment approach: at the category level, we develop a coupling technique by virtue of the dual-branch structure, leading to reduced divergence between the category distributions of the two domains; at the feature level, we introduce an adversarial perturbation strategy to better augment source domain feature, resulting in improved alignment in feature distribution. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to alleviate the domain shift issue for WSI data analysis. Extensive experiments on four TCGA datasets have validated the effectiveness of our proposed DETA framework and demonstrated its superior performance in WSI-based survival analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[NACNet: A Histology Context-aware Transformer Graph Convolution Network for Predicting Treatment Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09766v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (Nov 07 2024)</p></details> |

Although computer-aided diagnostic systems have shown considerable value in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, the problem of multi-classification under sample imbalance remains an intractable challenge. To address this, we propose learning fine-grained information by generating sub-bags with feature distributions similar to the original WSIs. Additionally, we utilize a pseudo-bag generation algorithm to further leverage the abundant and redundant information in WSIs, allowing efficient training in unbalanced-sample multi-classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an affinity-based sample selection and curriculum contrastive learning strategy to enhance the stability of model representation learning. Unlike previous approaches, our framework transitions from learning bag-level representations to understanding and exploiting the feature distribution of multi-instance bags. Our method demonstrates significant performance improvements on three datasets, including tumor classification and lymph node metastasis. On average, it achieves a 4.39-point improvement in F1 score compared to the second-best method across the three tasks, underscoring its superior performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Towards a Comprehensive Benchmark for Pathological Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer Sections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10752v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in optical microscopy scanning have significantly contributed to computational pathology (CPath) by converting traditional histopathological slides into whole slide images (WSIs). This development enables comprehensive digital reviews by pathologists and accelerates AI-driven diagnostic support for WSI analysis. Recent advances in foundational pathology models have increased the need for benchmarking tasks. The Camelyon series is one of the most widely used open-source datasets in computational pathology. However, the quality, accessibility, and clinical relevance of the labels have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs and labels from the Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17 datasets, removing low-quality slides, correcting erroneous labels, and providing expert pixel annotations for tumor regions in the previously unreleased test set. Based on the sizes of re-annotated tumor regions, we upgraded the binary cancer screening task to a four-class task: negative, micro-metastasis, macro-metastasis, and Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC). We reevaluated pre-trained pathology feature extractors and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods using the cleaned dataset, providing a benchmark that advances AI development in histopathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnostic Text-guided Representation Learning in Hierarchical Classification for Pathological Whole Slide Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10709v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of digital imaging in medical microscopy, artificial intelligent-based analysis of pathological whole slide images (WSIs) provides a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis. Limited by the expensive cost of pixel-level annotation, current research primarily focuses on representation learning with slide-level labels, showing success in various downstream tasks. However, given the diversity of lesion types and the complex relationships between each other, these techniques still deserve further exploration in addressing advanced pathology tasks. To this end, we introduce the concept of hierarchical pathological image classification and propose a representation learning called PathTree. PathTree considers the multi-classification of diseases as a binary tree structure. Each category is represented as a professional pathological text description, which messages information with a tree-like encoder. The interactive text features are then used to guide the aggregation of hierarchical multiple representations. PathTree uses slide-text similarity to obtain probability scores and introduces two extra tree specific losses to further constrain the association between texts and slides. Through extensive experiments on three challenging hierarchical classification datasets: in-house cryosectioned lung tissue lesion identification, public prostate cancer grade assessment, and public breast cancer subtyping, our proposed PathTree is consistently competitive compared to the state-of-the-art methods and provides a new perspective on the deep learning-assisted solution for more complex WSI classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

Foundation models have the potential to improve generalizability within and across centers and serve as starting points for data efficient development of specialized yet robust AI models. However, the training foundation models themselves is usually very expensive in terms of data, computation, and time. This paper proposes a supervised training method that drastically reduces these expenses. The proposed method is based on multi-task learning to train a joint encoder, by combining 16 different classification, segmentation, and detection tasks on a total of 912,000 patches. Since the encoder is capable of capturing the properties of the samples, we term it the Tissue Concepts encoder. To evaluate the performance and generalizability of the Tissue Concepts encoder across centers, classification of whole slide images from four of the most prevalent solid cancers - breast, colon, lung, and prostate - was used. The experiments show that the Tissue Concepts model achieve comparable performance to models trained with self-supervision, while requiring only 6% of the amount of training patches. Furthermore, the Tissue Concepts encoder outperforms an ImageNet pre-trained encoder on both in-domain and out-of-domain data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 Pa...</summary><p>22 Pages, 3 Figures, submitted to and under revision at Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE. The source code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CATE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Fetal Inflammatory Response Diagnosis in the Umbilical Cord](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09767v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inflammation of the umbilical cord can be seen as a result of ascending intrauterine infection or other inflammatory stimuli. Acute fetal inflammatory response (FIR) is characterized by infiltration of the umbilical cord by fetal neutrophils, and can be associated with neonatal sepsis or fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Recent advances in deep learning in digital pathology have demonstrated favorable performance across a wide range of clinical tasks, such as diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we classified FIR from whole slide images (WSI). We digitized 4100 histological slides of umbilical cord stained with hematoxylin and eosin(H&E) and extracted placental diagnoses from the electronic health record. We build models using attention-based whole slide learning models. We compared strategies between features extracted by a model (ConvNeXtXLarge) pretrained on non-medical images (ImageNet), and one pretrained using histopathology images (UNI). We trained multiple iterations of each model and combined them into an ensemble. The predictions from the ensemble of models trained using UNI achieved an overall balanced accuracy of 0.836 on the test dataset. In comparison, the ensembled predictions using ConvNeXtXLarge had a lower balanced accuracy of 0.7209. Heatmaps generated from top accuracy model appropriately highlighted arteritis in cases of FIR 2. In FIR 1, the highest performing model assigned high attention to areas of activated-appearing stroma in Wharton's Jelly. However, other high-performing models assigned attention to umbilical vessels. We developed models for diagnosis of FIR from placental histology images, helping reduce interobserver variability among pathologists. Future work may examine the utility of these models for identifying infants at risk of systemic inflammatory response or early onset neonatal sepsis.</p></details> |  |

This leads to a late diagnosis of the tumor, where the curability likelihood is lower, and makes the mortality rate of Renal Cell Carcinoma high, with respect to its incidence rate. To increase the survival chance, a fast and correct categorization of the tumor subtype is paramount. Nowadays, computerized methods, based on artificial intelligence, represent an interesting opportunity to improve the productivity and the objectivity of the microscopy-based Renal Cell Carcinoma diagnosis. Nonetheless, much of their exploitation is hampered by the paucity of annotated dataset, essential for a proficient training of supervised machine learning technologies. This study sets out to investigate a novel self supervised training strategy for machine learning diagnostic tools, based on the multi-resolution nature of the histological samples. We aim at reducing the need of annotated dataset, without significantly reducing the accuracy of the tool. We demonstrate the classification capability of our tool on a whole slide imaging dataset for Renal Cancer subtyping, and we compare our solution with several state-of-the-art classification counterparts.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient Whole Slide Image Classification through Fisher Vector Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08530v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of digital pathology, particularly through computational analysis of whole slide images (WSI), is poised to significantly enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency. However, the large size and complexity of WSIs make it difficult to analyze and classify them using computers. This study introduces a novel method for WSI classification by automating the identification and examination of the most informative patches, thus eliminating the need to process the entire slide. Our method involves two-stages: firstly, it extracts only a few patches from the WSIs based on their pathological significance; and secondly, it employs Fisher vectors (FVs) for representing features extracted from these patches, which is known for its robustness in capturing fine-grained details. This approach not only accentuates key pathological features within the WSI representation but also significantly reduces computational overhead, thus making the process more efficient and scalable. We have rigorously evaluated the proposed method across multiple datasets to benchmark its performance against comprehensive WSI analysis and contemporary weakly-supervised learning methodologies. The empirical results indicate that our focused analysis of select patches, combined with Fisher vector representation, not only aligns with, but at times surpasses, the classification accuracy of standard practices. Moreover, this strategy notably diminishes computational load and resource expenditure, thereby establishing an efficient and precise framework for WSI analysis in the realm of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[CIMIL-CRC: a clinically-informed multiple instance learning framework for patient-level colorectal cancer molecular subtypes classification from H\&E stained images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16131v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Treatment approaches for colorectal cancer (CRC) are highly dependent on the molecular subtype, as immunotherapy has shown efficacy in cases with microsatellite instability (MSI) but is ineffective for the microsatellite stable (MSS) subtype. There is promising potential in utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) to automate the differentiation of CRC subtypes by analyzing Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). Due to the extensive size of WSIs, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques are typically explored. However, existing MIL methods focus on identifying the most representative image patches for classification, which may result in the loss of critical information. Additionally, these methods often overlook clinically relevant information, like the tendency for MSI class tumors to predominantly occur on the proximal (right side) colon. We introduce `CIMIL-CRC', a DNN framework that: 1) solves the MSI/MSS MIL problem by efficiently combining a pre-trained feature extraction model with principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate information from all patches, and 2) integrates clinical priors, particularly the tumor location within the colon, into the model to enhance patient-level classification accuracy. We assessed our CIMIL-CRC method using the average area under the curve (AUC) from a 5-fold cross-validation experimental setup for model development on the TCGA-CRC-DX cohort, contrasting it with a baseline patch-level classification, MIL-only approach, and Clinically-informed patch-level classification approach. Our CIMIL-CRC outperformed all methods (AUROC: $0.92\pm0.002$ (95\% CI 0.91-0.92), vs. $0.79\pm0.02$ (95\% CI 0.76-0.82), $0.86\pm0.01$ (95\% CI 0.85-0.88), and $0.87\pm0.01$ (95\% CI 0.86-0.88), respectively).

Everyone over 50 years of age in Canada is eligible for CRC screening. About 20\% of those people will undergo a biopsy for a pre-neoplastic polyp and, in many cases, multiple polyps. As such, these polyp biopsies make up the bulk of a pathologist's workload. Developing an efficient computational model to help screen these polyp biopsies can improve the pathologist's workflow and help guide their attention to critical areas on the slide. DL models face significant challenges in computational pathology (CPath) because of the gigapixel image size of whole-slide images and the scarcity of detailed annotated datasets. It is, therefore, crucial to leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to alleviate the burden and cost of data annotation. However, current research lacks methods to apply SSL frameworks to analyze pathology data effectively. This paper aims to propose an optimized Barlow Twins framework for colorectal polyps screening. We adapt its hyperparameters, augmentation strategy and encoder to the specificity of the pathology data to enhance performance. Additionally, we investigate the best Field of View (FoV) for colorectal polyps screening and propose a new benchmark dataset for CRC screening, made of four types of colorectal polyps and normal tissue, by performing downstream tasking on MHIST and NCT-CRC-7K datasets. Furthermore, we show that the SSL representations are more meaningful and qualitative than the supervised ones and that Barlow Twins benefits from the Swin Transformer when applied to pathology data.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, the development of numerous models based on convolutional neural networks and transformer-based models has been applied to the precise segmentation of WSIs. However, due to privacy regulations and the need to protect patient confidentiality, centralized storage and processing of image data are impractical. Training a centralized model directly is challenging to implement in medical settings due to these privacy concerns.This paper addresses the dispersed nature and privacy sensitivity of medical image data by employing a federated learning framework, allowing medical institutions to collaboratively learn while protecting patient privacy. Additionally, to address the issue of original data reconstruction through gradient inversion during the federated learning training process, differential privacy introduces noise into the model updates, preventing attackers from inferring the contributions of individual samples, thereby protecting the privacy of the training data.Experimental results show that the proposed method, FedDP, minimally impacts model accuracy while effectively safeguarding the privacy of cancer pathology image data, with only a slight decrease in Dice, Jaccard, and Acc indices by 0.55%, 0.63%, and 0.42%, respectively. This approach facilitates cross-institutional collaboration and knowledge sharing while protecting sensitive data privacy, providing a viable solution for further research and application in the medical field.</p></details> | Accepted in BIBM2024 |
| **[Virchow2: Scaling Self-Supervised Mixed Magnification Models in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00738v3)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are rapidly being developed for computational pathology applications. However, it remains an open question which factors are most important for downstream performance with data scale and diversity, model size, and training algorithm all playing a role. In this work, we propose algorithmic modifications, tailored for pathology, and we present the result of scaling both data and model size, surpassing previous studies in both dimensions. We introduce three new models: Virchow2, a 632 million parameter vision transformer, Virchow2G, a 1.9 billion parameter vision transformer, and Virchow2G Mini, a 22 million parameter distillation of Virchow2G, each trained with 3.1 million histopathology whole slide images, with diverse tissues, originating institutions, and stains. We achieve state of the art performance on 12 tile-level tasks, as compared to the top performing competing models. Our results suggest that data diversity and domain-specific methods can outperform models that only scale in the number of parameters, but, on average, performance benefits from the combination of domain-specific methods, data scale, and model scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Transfer Learning and Multiple Instance Learning for HER2 Automatic Scoring of H\&E Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05028v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker in breast cancer patients who can benefit from cost-effective automatic Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) HER2 scoring. However, developing such scoring models requires large pixel-level annotated datasets. Transfer learning allows prior knowledge from different datasets to be reused while multiple-instance learning (MIL) allows the lack of detailed annotations to be mitigated. The aim of this work is to examine the potential of transfer learning on the performance of deep learning models pre-trained on (i) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, (ii) H\&E images and (iii) non-medical images. A MIL framework with an attention mechanism is developed using pre-trained models as patch-embedding models. It was found that embedding models pre-trained on H\&E images consistently outperformed the others, resulting in an average AUC-ROC value of $0.622$ across the 4 HER2 scores ($0.59-0.80$ per HER2 score). Furthermore, it was found that using multiple-instance learning with an attention layer not only allows for good classification results to be achieved, but it can also help with producing visual indication of HER2-positive areas in the H\&E slide image by utilising the patch-wise attention weights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine learning identification of maternal inflammatory response and histologic choroamnionitis from placental membrane whole slide images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02354v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The placenta forms a critical barrier to infection through pregnancy, labor and, delivery. Inflammatory processes in the placenta have short-term, and long-term consequences for offspring health. Digital pathology and machine learning can play an important role in understanding placental inflammation, and there have been very few investigations into methods for predicting and understanding Maternal Inflammatory Response (MIR). This work intends to investigate the potential of using machine learning to understand MIR based on whole slide images (WSI), and establish early benchmarks. To that end, we use Multiple Instance Learning framework with 3 feature extractors: ImageNet-based EfficientNet-v2s, and 2 histopathology foundation models, UNI and Phikon to investigate predictability of MIR stage from histopathology WSIs. We also interpret predictions from these models using the learned attention maps from these models. We also use the MIL framework for predicting white blood cells count (WBC) and maximum fever temperature ($T_{max}$). Attention-based MIL models are able to classify MIR with a balanced accuracy of up to 88.5% with a Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa$) of up to 0.772. Furthermore, we found that the pathology foundation models (UNI and Phikon) are both able to achieve higher performance with balanced accuracy and $\kappa$, compared to ImageNet-based feature extractor (EfficientNet-v2s). For WBC and $T_{max}$ prediction, we found mild correlation between actual values and those predicted from histopathology WSIs. We used MIL framework for predicting MIR stage from WSIs, and compared effectiveness of foundation models as feature extractors, with that of an ImageNet-based model. We further investigated model failure cases and found them to be either edge cases prone to interobserver variability, examples of pathologist's overreach, or mislabeled due to processing errors.</p></details> |  |

However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology, as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,229 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and extensive metadata. HEST-1k was assembled from 153 public and internal cohorts encompassing 26 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 367 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 2.1 million expression--morphology pairs and over 76 million nuclei. To support its development, we additionally introduce the HEST-Library, a Python package designed to perform a range of actions with HEST samples. We test HEST-1k and Library on three use cases: (1) benchmarking foundation models for pathology (HEST-Benchmark), (2) biomarker exploration, and (3) multimodal representation learning. HEST-1k, HEST-Library, and HEST-Benchmark can be freely accessed at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/hest.</p></details> | NeurIPS'24 Spotlight |
| **[How Good Are We? Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MamMIL: Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images with State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05160v3)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pathological diagnosis has achieved superior performance by combining deep learning models with the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework using whole slide images (WSIs). However, the giga-pixeled nature of WSIs poses a great challenge for efficient MIL. Existing studies either do not consider global dependencies among instances, or use approximations such as linear attentions to model the pair-to-pair instance interactions, which inevitably brings performance bottlenecks. To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework named MamMIL for WSI analysis by cooperating the selective structured state space model (i.e., Mamba) with MIL, enabling the modeling of global instance dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. Specifically, considering the irregularity of the tissue regions in WSIs, we represent each WSI as an undirected graph. To address the problem that Mamba can only process 1D sequences, we further propose a topology-aware scanning mechanism to serialize the WSI graphs while preserving the topological relationships among the instances. Finally, in order to further perceive the topological structures among the instances and incorporate short-range feature interactions, we propose an instance aggregation block based on graph neural networks. Experiments show that MamMIL can achieve advanced performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks.

Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths. The model is made freely available in FastPathology and the code is available at https://github.com/AICAN-Research/breast-epithelium-segmentation</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

Most multimodal deep learning approaches use modality-specific architectures that are often trained separately and cannot capture the crucial cross-modal information that motivates the integration of different data sources. This paper presents the Hybrid Early-fusion Attention Learning Network (HEALNet): a flexible multimodal fusion architecture, which a) preserves modality-specific structural information, b) captures the cross-modal interactions and structural information in a shared latent space, c) can effectively handle missing modalities during training and inference, and d) enables intuitive model inspection by learning on the raw data input instead of opaque embeddings. We conduct multimodal survival analysis on Whole Slide Images and Multi-omic data on four cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). HEALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other end-to-end trained fusion models, substantially improving over unimodal and multimodal baselines whilst being robust in scenarios with missing modalities.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Deep Learning for Classification of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity in Whole Slide Images of Colonic Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19690v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grading inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity using standardized histopathological scoring systems remains challenging due to resource constraints and inter-observer variability. In this study, we developed a deep learning model to classify activity grades in hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from patients with IBD, offering a robust approach for general pathologists. We utilized 2,077 WSIs from 636 patients treated at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in 2018 and 2019, scanned at 40x magnification (0.25 micron/pixel). Board-certified gastrointestinal pathologists categorized the WSIs into four activity classes: inactive, mildly active, moderately active, and severely active. A transformer-based model was developed and validated using five-fold cross-validation to classify IBD activity. Using HoVerNet, we examined neutrophil distribution across activity grades. Attention maps from our model highlighted areas contributing to its prediction. The model classified IBD activity with weighted averages of 0.871 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.860-0.883] for the area under the curve, 0.695 [95% CI: 0.674-0.715] for precision, 0.697 [95% CI: 0.678-0.716] for recall, and 0.695 [95% CI: 0.674-0.714] for F1-score. Neutrophil distribution was significantly different across activity classes. Qualitative evaluation of attention maps by a gastrointestinal pathologist suggested their potential for improved interpretability. Our model demonstrates robust diagnostic performance and could enhance consistency and efficiency in IBD activity assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCT-HistoTransformer: Efficient Lightweight Vision Transformer with DCT Integration for histopathological image analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19166v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the integration of advanced imaging techniques and deep learning methods has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for breast cancer detection and classification. Transformers, which have shown great promise in computer vision, are now being applied to medical image analysis. However, their application to histopathological images presents challenges due to the need for extensive manual annotations of whole-slide images (WSIs), as these models require large amounts of data to work effectively, which is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, the quadratic computational cost of Vision Transformers (ViTs) is particularly prohibitive for large, high-resolution histopathological images, especially on edge devices with limited computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel lightweight breast cancer classification approach using transformers that operates effectively without large datasets. By incorporating parallel processing pathways for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Attention and MobileConv, we convert image data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain to utilize the benefits such as filtering out high frequencies in the image, which reduces computational cost. This demonstrates the potential of our approach to improve breast cancer classification in histopathological images, offering a more efficient solution with reduced reliance on extensive annotated datasets. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 96.00% $\pm$ 0.48% for binary classification and 87.85% $\pm$ 0.93% for multiclass classification, which is comparable to state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational costs. This demonstrates the potential of our approach to improve breast cancer classification in histopathological images, offering a more efficient solution with reduced reliance on extensive annotated datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for 2024 9th International Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)</p></details> |

The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). We will fully release SlideChat, SlideInstruction and SlideBench as open-source resources to facilitate research and development in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods cannot effectively capture the intricate interaction features among instances within the local area of WSI. Moreover, existing methods for cancer survival prediction based on WSI often fail to provide better clinically meaningful predictions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Sparse Context-aware Multiple Instance Learning (SCMIL) framework for predicting cancer survival probability distributions. SCMIL innovatively segments patches into various clusters based on their morphological features and spatial location information, subsequently leveraging sparse self-attention to discern the relationships between these patches with a context-aware perspective. Considering many patches are irrelevant to the task, we introduce a learnable patch filtering module called SoftFilter, which ensures that only interactions between task-relevant patches are considered. To enhance the clinical relevance of our prediction, we propose a register-based mixture density network to forecast the survival probability distribution for individual patients. We evaluate SCMIL on two public WSI datasets from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) specifically focusing on lung adenocarcinom (LUAD) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Our experimental results indicate that SCMIL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for survival prediction, offering more clinically meaningful and interpretable outcomes.

However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework.

| **[Rethinking Transformer for Long Contextual Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14195v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard for clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop computer-aided diagnosis model for WSIs, previous methods typically employ Multi-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level labels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise interactions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model contextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized to address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long sequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL employs approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from suboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use of absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long contextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze how the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the representation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of attention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local attention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the attention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the local attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation, reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local bandwidth. Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration and local-global information interactions modelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through extensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority. Our code will be available at github.com/invoker-LL/Long-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS-2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.12885</p></details> |

Consequently, these types of data must be pseudonymized prior to utilisation, which presents a significant challenge for many researchers. Given the vast array of medical data, it is necessary to employ a variety of de-identification techniques. To facilitate the anonymization process for medical imaging data, we have developed an open-source tool that can be used to de-identify DICOM magnetic resonance images, computer tomography images, whole slide images and magnetic resonance twix raw data. Furthermore, the implementation of a neural network enables the removal of text within the images. The proposed tool automates an elaborate anonymization pipeline for multiple types of inputs, reducing the need for additional tools used for de-identification of imaging data. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/code-lukas/medical_image_deidentification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence-Based Triaging of Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10509v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists are facing an increasing workload due to a growing volume of cases and the need for more comprehensive diagnoses. Aiming to facilitate workload reduction and faster turnaround times, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model for triaging cutaneous melanocytic lesions based on whole slide images. The AI model was developed and validated using a retrospective cohort from the UMC Utrecht. The dataset consisted of 52,202 whole slide images from 27,167 unique specimens, acquired from 20,707 patients. Specimens with only common nevi were assigned to the low complexity category (86.6%). In contrast, specimens with any other melanocytic lesion subtype, including non-common nevi, melanocytomas, and melanomas, were assigned to the high complexity category (13.4%). The dataset was split on patient level into a development set (80%) and test sets (20%) for independent evaluation. Predictive performance was primarily measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). A simulation experiment was performed to study the effect of implementing AI-based triaging in the clinic. The AI model reached an AUROC of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960-0.972) and an AUPRC of 0.857 (95% CI, 0.836-0.877) on the in-distribution test set, and an AUROC of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.860-0.934) and an AUPRC of 0.498 (95% CI, 0.360-0.639) on the out-of-distribution test set. In the simulation experiment, using random case assignment as baseline, AI-based triaging prevented an average of 43.9 (95% CI, 36-55) initial examinations of high complexity cases by general pathologists for every 500 cases.

| **[Slide-based Graph Collaborative Training for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10260v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of computational pathology lies in the consensus that pathological characteristics of tumors are significant guidance for cancer diagnostics. Most existing research focuses on the inner-contextual information within each WSI yet ignores the possible inter-correlations between slides. As the development of tumors is a continuous process involving a series of histological, morphological, and genetic changes that accumulate over time, the similarities and differences between WSIs across various stages, grades, locations and patients should potentially contribute to the representation of WSIs and deserve to be taken into account in WSI modeling. To verify the advancement of introducing the slide inter-correlations into the representation learning of WSIs, we proposed a generic WSI analysis pipeline SlideGCD that can be adapted to any existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks and improve their performance. With the new paradigm, the prior knowledge of cancer development can participate in the end-to-end workflow, which concurrently initializes and refines the slide representation, as a guide for message passing in the slide-based graph. Extensive comparisons and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed pipeline across 4 different tasks, including cancer subtyping, cancer staging, survival prediction, and gene mutation prediction, with 7 representative SOTA WSI analysis frameworks as backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMIL: Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Cancer Detection and Subtyping in Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05314v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visual examination of tissue biopsy sections is fundamental for cancer diagnosis, with pathologists analyzing sections at multiple magnifications to discern tumor cells and their subtypes. However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\%, 95.9\%, and 88.1\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CAMIL enhances model interpretability by identifying regions of high diagnostic value.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

However, current methods fall short in bridging the domain gap between pretrained models and medical imaging, and often fail to account for spatial relationships across different magnifications. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Concentric Dual Fusion Attention-MIL (CDFA-MIL) framework,which innovatively combines point-to-area feature-colum attention and point-to-point concentric-row attention using concentric patch. This approach is designed to effectively fuse correlated information, enhancing feature representation and providing stronger correlation guidance for WSI analysis. CDFA-MIL distinguishes itself by offering a robust fusion strategy that leads to superior WSI recognition. Its application has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly surpassing existing MIL methods in accuracy and F1 scores on prominent datasets like Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Specifically, CDFA-MIL achieved an average accuracy and F1-score of 93.7\% and 94.1\% respectively on these datasets, marking a notable advancement over traditional MIL approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need for additional experiments</p></details> |

They are intended to be general-purpose feature extractors, promising to achieve good performance on a range of downstream tasks. Real-world pathology image data does however exhibit considerable variability. Foundation models should be robust to these variations and other distribution shifts which might be encountered in practice. We evaluate two computational pathology foundation models: UNI (trained on more than 100,000 whole-slide images) and CONCH (trained on more than 1.1 million image-caption pairs), by utilizing them as feature extractors within prostate cancer grading models. We find that while UNI and CONCH perform well relative to baselines, the absolute performance can still be far from satisfactory in certain settings. The fact that foundation models have been trained on large and varied datasets does not guarantee that downstream models always will be robust to common distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

However, the practicability of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs has not yet been validated in real-world practice. In this paper, we applied LAF to two tasks of tumour segmentation for breast cancer (TSfBC) in medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA) for evaluations with IAGTLs. Experimental results and analysis show that the LAF-based evaluations with IAGTLs were unable to confidently act like usual evaluations with accurate ground-truth labels on the one easier task of TSfBC while being able to reasonably act like usual evaluations with AGTLs on the other more difficult task of TSfBC. These results and analysis reflect the potential of LAF applied to MHWSIA for evaluations with IAGTLs. This paper presents the first practical validation of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs in a real-world application.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the final published version</p></details> |

A WSI, acquired at gigapixel size, is commonly tiled into patches and processed by multiple-instance learning (MIL) models. Previous MIL-based models designed for this problem have only been evaluated on individual tasks for specific organs, and the ability to handle multiple tasks within a single model has not been investigated. In this study, we propose MECFormer, a generative Transformer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks within one model. To leverage the power of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and to enhance the model's effectiveness in focusing on each individual task, we introduce an Expert Consultation Network, a projection layer placed at the beginning of the Transformer-based model. Additionally, to enable flexible classification, autoregressive decoding is incorporated by a language decoder for WSI classification. Through extensive experiments on five datasets involving four different organs, one cancer classification task, and four cancer subtyping tasks, MECFormer demonstrates superior performance compared to individual state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ACCV2024</p></details> |

Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

State-of-the-art methods use self-supervised patch-wise feature representations for multiple instance learning (MIL). Recently, methods have been proposed to fine-tune the feature representation on the downstream task using pseudo labeling, but mostly focusing on selecting high-quality positive patches. In this paper, we propose to mine hard negative samples during fine-tuning. This allows us to obtain better feature representations and reduce the training cost. Furthermore, we propose a novel patch-wise ranking loss in MIL to better exploit these hard negative samples. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of these proposed ideas.

In this paper, we present a novel approach that uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for automatic melanoma segmentation in microscopy slide images. Our method employs an initial semantic segmentation model to generate preliminary segmentation masks that are then used to prompt SAM. We design a dynamic prompting strategy that uses a combination of centroid and grid prompts to achieve optimal coverage of the super high-resolution slide images while maintaining the quality of generated prompts. To optimize for invasive melanoma segmentation, we further refine the prompt generation process by implementing in-situ melanoma detection and low-confidence region filtering. We select Segformer as the initial segmentation model and EfficientSAM as the segment anything model for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only surpasses other state-of-the-art melanoma segmentation methods but also significantly outperforms the baseline Segformer by 9.1% in terms of IoU.</p></details> |  |
| **[WEEP: A method for spatial interpretation of weakly supervised CNN models in computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15238v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning enables the modelling of high-resolution histopathology whole-slide images (WSI). Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Seamless Virtual Immunohistochemical Whole Slide Images with Content and Color Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01072v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains play a vital role in a pathologist's analysis of medical images, providing crucial diagnostic information for various diseases. Virtual staining from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) allows the automatic production of other useful IHC stains without the expensive physical staining process. However, current virtual WSI generation methods based on tile-wise processing often suffer from inconsistencies in content, texture, and color at tile boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to artifacts that compromise image quality and potentially hinder accurate clinical assessment and diagnoses. To address this limitation, we propose a novel consistent WSI synthesis network, CC-WSI-Net, that extends GAN models to produce seamless synthetic whole slide images. Our CC-WSI-Net integrates a content- and color-consistency supervisor, ensuring consistency across tiles and facilitating the generation of seamless synthetic WSIs while ensuring Sox10 immunohistochemistry accuracy in melanocyte detection. We validate our method through extensive image-quality analyses, objective detection assessments, and a subjective survey with pathologists. By generating high-quality synthetic WSIs, our method opens doors for advanced virtual staining techniques with broader applications in research and clinical care.</p></details> |  |

While such WSI-based gene-expression prediction models have recently emerged within computational pathology, the high-dimensional nature of the corresponding regression problem offers numerous design choices which remain to be analyzed in detail. This study provides recommendations on how deep regression models should be trained for WSI-based gene-expression prediction. For example, we conclude that training a single model to simultaneously regress all 20530 genes is a computationally efficient yet very strong baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: A Dual-tier Few-Shot Learning Paradigm for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19720v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the primary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole Slide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike few-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of each image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small number of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in order to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining of available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address the above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level annotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs at the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to fully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch labels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the labels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch classification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior branch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of visual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the results from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches the accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\%$ annotation costs. All codes and models will be publicly available on https://github.com/fukexue/FAST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Quality Control of Whole Slide Pathology Images with Human-in-the-loop Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19587v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) are being widely used to develop deep learning-based diagnostic solutions, especially for precision oncology. Most of these diagnostic softwares are vulnerable to biases and impurities in the training and test data which can lead to inaccurate diagnoses. For instance, WSIs contain multiple types of tissue regions, at least some of which might not be relevant to the diagnosis. We introduce HistoROI, a robust yet lightweight deep learning-based classifier to segregate WSI into six broad tissue regions -- epithelium, stroma, lymphocytes, adipose, artifacts, and miscellaneous. HistoROI is trained using a novel human-in-the-loop and active learning paradigm that ensures variations in training data for labeling-efficient generalization. HistoROI consistently performs well across multiple organs, despite being trained on only a single dataset, demonstrating strong generalization. Further, we have examined the utility of HistoROI in improving the performance of downstream deep learning-based tasks using the CAMELYON breast cancer lymph node and TCGA lung cancer datasets. For the former dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for metastasis versus normal tissue of a neural network trained using weakly supervised learning increased from 0.88 to 0.92 by filtering the data using HistoROI. Similarly, the AUC increased from 0.88 to 0.93 for the classification between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma on the lung cancer dataset. We also found that the performance of the HistoROI improves upon HistoQC for artifact detection on a test dataset of 93 annotated WSIs. The limitations of the proposed model are analyzed, and potential extensions are also discussed.</p></details> | 18 pages |

As a test for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections, Gram stains provide critical early data to inform patient treatment. Rapid and reliable analysis of Gram stains has been shown to be positively associated with better clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for improved tools to automate Gram stain analysis. In this work, we developed a novel transformer-based model for Gram-stained WSI classification, which is more scalable to large datasets than previous convolutional neural network (CNN) -based methods as it does not require patch-level manual annotations. We also introduce a large Gram stain dataset from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA) to evaluate our model, exploring the classification of five major categories of Gram-stained WSIs: Gram-positive cocci in clusters, Gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains, Gram-positive rods, Gram-negative rods, and slides with no bacteria. Our model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.858 (95% CI: 0.805, 0.905) and an AUC of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.922, 0.976) using five-fold nested cross-validation on our 475-slide dataset, demonstrating the potential of large-scale transformer models for Gram stain classification. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our trained model, which achieves strong performance on external datasets without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNICORN: A Deep Learning Model for Integrating Multi-Stain Data in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17775v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: The integration of multi-stain histopathology images through deep learning poses a significant challenge in digital histopathology. Current multi-modal approaches struggle with data heterogeneity and missing data. This study aims to overcome these limitations by developing a novel transformer model for multi-stain integration that can handle missing data during training as well as inference. Methods: We propose UNICORN (UNiversal modality Integration Network for CORonary classificatioN) a multi-modal transformer capable of processing multi-stain histopathology for atherosclerosis severity class prediction. The architecture comprises a two-stage, end-to-end trainable model with specialized modules utilizing transformer self-attention blocks. The initial stage employs domain-specific expert modules to extract features from each modality. In the subsequent stage, an aggregation expert module integrates these features by learning the interactions between the different data modalities. Results: Evaluation was performed using a multi-class dataset of atherosclerotic lesions from the Munich Cardiovascular Studies Biobank (MISSION), using over 4,000 paired multi-stain whole slide images (WSIs) from 170 deceased individuals on 7 prespecified segments of the coronary tree, each stained according to four histopathological protocols. UNICORN achieved a classification accuracy of 0.67, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. The model effectively identifies relevant tissue phenotypes across stainings and implicitly models disease progression. Conclusion: Our proposed multi-modal transformer model addresses key challenges in medical data analysis, including data heterogeneity and missing modalities. Explainability and the model's effectiveness in predicting atherosclerosis progression underscores its potential for broader applications in medical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[HER2 and FISH Status Prediction in Breast Biopsy H&E-Stained Images Using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13818v3)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current standard for detecting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer patients relies on HER2 amplification, identified through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) tumor stains are more widely available, and accurately predicting HER2 status using H\&E could reduce costs and expedite treatment selection. Deep Learning algorithms for H&E have shown effectiveness in predicting various cancer features and clinical outcomes, including moderate success in HER2 status prediction. In this work, we employed a customized weak supervision classification technique combined with MoCo-v2 contrastive learning to predict HER2 status. We trained our pipeline on 182 publicly available H&E Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), for which annotations by the pathology team at Yale School of Medicine are publicly available. Our pipeline achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 across four different test folds. Additionally, we tested our model on 44 H&E slides from the TCGA-BRCA dataset, which had an HER2 score of 2+ and included corresponding HER2 status and FISH test results. These cases are considered equivocal for IHC, requiring an expensive FISH test on their IHC slides for disambiguation. Our pipeline demonstrated an AUC of 0.81 on these challenging H&E slides. Reducing the need for FISH test can have significant implications in cancer treatment equity for underserved populations.</p></details> |  |

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |

Current prognostic tools like Oncotype DX (ODX) offer valuable genomic insights for HR+/HER2- patients but are limited by cost and accessibility, particularly in underserved populations. In this study, we present Deep-BCR-Auto, a deep learning-based computational pathology approach that predicts breast cancer recurrence risk from routine H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Our methodology was validated on two independent cohorts: the TCGA-BRCA dataset and an in-house dataset from The Ohio State University (OSU). Deep-BCR-Auto demonstrated robust performance in stratifying patients into low- and high-recurrence risk categories. On the TCGA-BRCA dataset, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.827, significantly outperforming existing weakly supervised models (p=0.041). In the independent OSU dataset, Deep-BCR-Auto maintained strong generalizability, achieving an AUROC of 0.832, along with 82.0% accuracy, 85.0% specificity, and 67.7% sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of computational pathology as a cost-effective alternative for recurrence risk assessment, broadening access to personalized treatment strategies. This study underscores the clinical utility of integrating deep learning-based computational pathology into routine pathological assessment for breast cancer prognosis across diverse clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic and Historical Instance Comparison for Cervical Cell Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13987v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cytology screening from Papanicolaou (Pap) smears is a common and effective tool for the preventive clinical management of cervical cancer, where abnormal cell detection from whole slide images serves as the foundation for reporting cervical cytology. However, cervical cell detection remains challenging due to 1) hazily-defined cell types (e.g., ASC-US) with subtle morphological discrepancies caused by the dynamic cancerization process, i.e., cell class ambiguity, and 2) imbalanced class distributions of clinical data may cause missed detection, especially for minor categories, i.e., cell class imbalance. To this end, we propose a holistic and historical instance comparison approach for cervical cell detection. Specifically, we first develop a holistic instance comparison scheme enforcing both RoI-level and class-level cell discrimination. This coarse-to-fine cell comparison encourages the model to learn foreground-distinguishable and class-wise representations. To emphatically improve the distinguishability of minor classes, we then introduce a historical instance comparison scheme with a confident sample selection-based memory bank, which involves comparing current embeddings with historical embeddings for better cell instance discrimination. Extensive experiments and analysis on two large-scale cytology datasets including 42,592 and 114,513 cervical cells demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

However, this integration of multimodal data, specifically histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genetic sequencing data, presents unique challenges due to modality disparities and the need for scalable computational solutions. This paper addresses the scarcity of multimodal solutions, primarily centered around unimodal data solutions, thus limiting the realization of the rich insights that can be derived from integrating images and genomic data. Here, we introduce MarbliX ``Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX,'' an innovative multimodal framework that integrates histopathology images with immunogenomic sequencing data, encapsulating them into a concise binary patient code, referred to as ``monogram.'' This binary representation facilitates the establishment of a comprehensive archive, enabling clinicians to match similar cases. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of MarbliX to empower healthcare professionals with in-depth insights, leading to more precise diagnoses, reduced variability, and expanded personalized treatment options, particularly in the context of cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Aggregator with Mask Denoise Mechanism for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11664v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology analysis is the gold standard for medical diagnosis. Accurate classification of whole slide images (WSIs) and region-of-interests (ROIs) localization can assist pathologists in diagnosis. The gigapixel resolution of WSI and the absence of fine-grained annotations make direct classification and analysis challenging. In weakly supervised learning, multiple instance learning (MIL) presents a promising approach for WSI classification. The prevailing strategy is to use attention mechanisms to measure instance importance for classification. However, attention mechanisms fail to capture inter-instance information, and self-attention causes quadratic computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose AMD-MIL, an agent aggregator with a mask denoise mechanism. The agent token acts as an intermediate variable between the query and key for computing instance importance. Mask and denoising matrices, mapped from agents-aggregated value, dynamically mask low-contribution representations and eliminate noise. AMD-MIL achieves better attention allocation by adjusting feature representations, capturing micro-metastases in cancer, and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, CAMELYON-17, TCGA-KIDNEY, and TCGA-LUNG show AMD-MIL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning approaches in this field predominantly focus on individual tumor types, limiting model generalization and scalability. This relatively narrow focus ultimately stems from the inherent heterogeneity in histopathology and the diverse morphological and molecular characteristics of different tumors. To this end, we propose a novel approach for multi-cohort WSI analysis, designed to leverage the diversity of different tumor types. We introduce a Cohort-Aware Attention module, enabling the capture of both shared and tumor-specific pathological patterns, enhancing cross-tumor generalization. Furthermore, we construct an adversarial cohort regularization mechanism to minimize cohort-specific biases through mutual information minimization. Additionally, we develop a hierarchical sample balancing strategy to mitigate cohort imbalances and promote unbiased learning. Together, these form a cohesive framework for unbiased multi-cohort WSI analysis. Extensive experiments on a uniquely constructed multi-cancer dataset demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, providing a scalable solution for WSI classification across diverse cancer types. Our code for the experiments is publicly available at <link>.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Therefore, it is critical to develop and deploy reliable models, especially for healthcare applications. However, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models designed for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) classification in computational pathology are not evaluated in terms of reliability. Hence, in this paper we compare the reliability of MIL models with three suggested metrics and use three region-wise annotated datasets.

We perform zero-shot retrievals, i.e., we do not alter embeddings and we do not train any classifier. As test data, we used diagnostic slides of TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas, consisting of 23 organs and 117 cancer subtypes. As a search platform we used Yottixel that enabled us to perform WSI search using patches. Achieved F1 scores show low performance, e.g., for top-5 retrievals, 27% +/- 13% (Yottixel-DenseNet), 42% +/- 14% (Yottixel-UNI), 40%+/-13% (Yottixel-Virchow), 41%+/-13% (Yottixel-GigaPath), and 41%+/-14% (GigaPath WSI).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be updated with more results</p></details> |

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been introduced for automated CRC subtype identification using H&E stained histopathological images, the correlation between CRC subtype genomic variants and their corresponding cellular morphology expressed by their imaging phenotypes is yet to be fully explored. The goal of this study was to determine such correlations by incorporating genomic variants in CNN models for CRC subtype classification from H&E images. We utilized the publicly available TCGA-CRC-DX dataset, which comprises whole slide images from 360 CRC-diagnosed patients (260 for training and 100 for testing). This dataset also provides information on CRC subtype classifications and genomic variations. We trained CNN models for CRC subtype classification that account for potential correlation between genomic variations within CRC subtypes and their corresponding cellular morphology patterns. We assessed the interplay between CRC subtypes' genomic variations and cellular morphology patterns by evaluating the CRC subtype classification accuracy of the different models in a stratified 5-fold cross-validation experimental setup using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and average precision (AP) as the performance metrics. Combining the CNN models account for variations in CIMP and SNP further improved classification accuracy (AUROC: 0.847$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.787$\pm$0.03, p$=$0.01, AP: 0.68$\pm$0.02 vs. 0.64$\pm$0.05).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show great promise across many tasks, but analyses have typically been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task. We report the most rigorous single-task validation of histopathology foundation models to date, specifically in ovarian cancer morphological subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using three ImageNet-pretrained feature extractors and fourteen histopathology foundation models. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for hold-out testing and external validation on the Transcanadian Study and OCEAN Challenge datasets. The best-performing model used the H-optimus-0 foundation model, with five-class balanced accuracies of 89%, 97%, and 74% in the test sets. Normalisations and augmentations aided the performance of the ImageNet-pretrained ResNets, but these were still outperformed by 13 of the 14 foundation models. Hyperparameter tuning the downstream classifiers improved performance by a median 1.9% balanced accuracy, with many improvements being statistically significant. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to ovarian cancer subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion to histopathologists diagnosing challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Classification of Histopathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13720v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses how to efficiently classify challenging histopathology images, such as gigapixel whole-slide images for cancer diagnostics with image-level annotation. We use images with annotated tumor regions to identify a set of tumor patches and a set of benign patches in a cancerous slide. Due to the variable nature of region of interest the tumor positive regions may refer to an extreme minority of the pixels. This creates an important problem during patch-level classification, where the majority of patches from an image labeled as 'cancerous' are actually tumor-free. This problem is different from semantic segmentation which associates a label to every pixel in an image, because after patch extraction we are only dealing with patch-level labels.Most existing approaches address the data imbalance issue by mitigating the data shortage in minority classes in order to prevent the model from being dominated by the majority classes. These methods include data re-sampling, loss re-weighting, margin modification, and data augmentation. In this work, we mitigate the patch-level class imbalance problem by taking a divide-and-conquer approach. First, we partition the data into sub-groups, and define three separate classification sub-problems based on these data partitions. Then, using an information-theoretic cluster-based sampling of deep image patch features, we sample discriminative patches from the sub-groups. Using these sampled patches, we build corresponding deep models to solve the new classification sub-problems. Finally, we integrate information learned from the respective models to make a final decision on the patches. Our result shows that the proposed approach can perform competitively using a very low percentage of the available patches in a given whole-slide image.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Accepted paper for the 27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Short Survey on Set-Based Aggregation Techniques for Single-Vector WSI Representation in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04615v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by enabling the digitization, storage, and analysis of tissue samples as whole slide images (WSIs). WSIs are gigapixel files that capture the intricate details of tissue samples, providing a rich source of information for diagnostic and research purposes. However, due to their enormous size, representing these images as one compact vector is essential for many computational pathology tasks, such as search and retrieval, to ensure efficiency and scalability. Most current methods are "patch-oriented," meaning they divide WSIs into smaller patches for processing, which prevents a holistic analysis of the entire slide. Additionally, the necessity for compact representation is driven by the expensive high-performance storage required for WSIs. Not all hospitals have access to such extensive storage solutions, leading to potential disparities in healthcare quality and accessibility. This paper provides an overview of existing set-based approaches to single-vector WSI representation, highlighting the innovations that allow for more efficient and effective use of these complex images in digital pathology, thus addressing both computational challenges and storage limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shapley Values-enabled Progressive Pseudo Bag Augmentation for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05490v4)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, whole-slide image (WSI) classification presents a formidable challenge due to its gigapixel resolution and limited fine-grained annotations. Multiple-instance learning (MIL) offers a weakly supervised solution, yet refining instance-level information from bag-level labels remains challenging. While most of the conventional MIL methods use attention scores to estimate instance importance scores (IIS) which contribute to the prediction of the slide labels, these often lead to skewed attention distributions and inaccuracies in identifying crucial instances. To address these issues, we propose a new approach inspired by cooperative game theory: employing Shapley values to assess each instance's contribution, thereby improving IIS estimation. The computation of the Shapley value is then accelerated using attention, meanwhile retaining the enhanced instance identification and prioritization. We further introduce a framework for the progressive assignment of pseudo bags based on estimated IIS, encouraging more balanced attention distributions in MIL models. Our extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, BRACS, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRCA datasets show our method's superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering enhanced interpretability and class-wise insights.

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention-mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and AMBIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.86$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.53$\pm$0.05, for tumor category, family and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disease Classification and Impact of Pretrained Deep Convolution Neural Networks on Diverse Medical Imaging Datasets across Imaging Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17011v2)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging techniques such as Chest X-rays, whole slide images, and optical coherence tomography serve as the initial screening and detection for a wide variety of medical pulmonary and ophthalmic conditions respectively. This paper investigates the intricacies of using pretrained deep convolutional neural networks with transfer learning across diverse medical imaging datasets with varying modalities for binary and multiclass classification. We conducted a comprehensive performance analysis with ten network architectures and model families each with pretraining and random initialization. Our finding showed that the use of pretrained models as fixed feature extractors yields poor performance irrespective of the datasets. Contrary, histopathology microscopy whole slide images have better performance. It is also found that deeper and more complex architectures did not necessarily result in the best performance. This observation implies that the improvements in ImageNet are not parallel to the medical imaging tasks. Within a medical domain, the performance of the network architectures varies within model families with shifts in datasets. This indicates that the performance of models within a specific modality may not be conclusive for another modality within the same domain. This study provides a deeper understanding of the applications of deep learning techniques in medical imaging and highlights the impact of pretrained networks across different medical imaging datasets under five different experimental settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression profiling are standard methods for molecular subtyping, IHC can be subjective, and gene profiling is costly and not widely accessible in many regions. Previous approaches have highlighted the potential application of deep learning models on H&E-stained whole slide images (WSI) for molecular subtyping, but these efforts vary in their methods, datasets, and reported performance. In this work, we investigated whether H&E-stained WSIs could be solely leveraged to predict breast cancer molecular subtypes (luminal A, B, HER2-enriched, and Basal). We used 1,433 WSIs of breast cancer in a two-step pipeline: first, classifying tumor and non-tumor tiles to use only the tumor regions for molecular subtyping; and second, employing a One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy to train four binary OvR classifiers and aggregating their results using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model. The pipeline was tested on 221 hold-out WSIs, achieving an overall macro F1 score of 0.95 for tumor detection and 0.73 for molecular subtyping. Our findings suggest that, with further validation, supervised deep learning models could serve as supportive tools for molecular subtyping in breast cancer. Our codes are made available to facilitate ongoing research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures (+4 supplementary figures), 4 tables</p></details> |

High-resolution WSIs are essential for precise diagnosis but technical limitations in scanning equipment and variablity in slide preparation can hinder obtaining these images. Super-resolution techniques can enhance low-resolution images; while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been effective in natural image super-resolution tasks, they often struggle with histopathology due to overfitting and mode collapse. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short in assessing the complex characteristics of histopathology images, necessitating robust histology-specific evaluation methods. We introduce Histo-Diffusion, a novel diffusion-based method specially designed for generating and evaluating super-resolution images in digital pathology. It includes a restoration module for histopathology prior and a controllable diffusion module for generating high-quality images. We have curated two histopathology datasets and proposed a comprehensive evaluation strategy which incorporates both full-reference and no-reference metrics to thoroughly assess the quality of digital pathology images. Comparative analyses on multiple datasets with state-of-the-art methods reveal that Histo-Diffusion outperforms GANs. Our method offers a versatile solution for histopathology image super-resolution, capable of handling multi-resolution generation from varied input sizes, providing valuable support in diagnostic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have submitted our paper to Medical Image Analysis and are currently awaiting feedback</p></details> |
| **[Mamba2MIL: State Space Duality Based Multiple Instance Learning for Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15032v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) has significantly advanced the clinical practice of pathology. Despite the progress made, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a promising paradigm within CPath, continues to face challenges, particularly related to incomplete information utilization. Existing frameworks, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), attention, and selective scan space state sequential model (SSM), lack sufficient flexibility and scalability in fusing diverse features, and cannot effectively fuse diverse features. Additionally, current approaches do not adequately exploit order-related and order-independent features, resulting in suboptimal utilization of sequence information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MIL framework called Mamba2MIL. Our framework utilizes the state space duality model (SSD) to model long sequences of patches of whole slide images (WSIs), which, combined with weighted feature selection, supports the fusion processing of more branching features and can be extended according to specific application needs. Moreover, we introduce a sequence transformation method tailored to varying WSI sizes, which enhances sequence-independent features while preserving local sequence information, thereby improving sequence information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mamba2MIL surpasses state-of-the-art MIL methods. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets, achieving improvements in nearly all performance metrics. Specifically, on the NSCLC dataset, Mamba2MIL achieves a binary tumor classification AUC of 0.9533 and an accuracy of 0.8794. On the BRACS dataset, it achieves a multiclass classification AUC of 0.7986 and an accuracy of 0.4981. The code is available at https://github.com/YuqiZhang-Buaa/Mamba2MIL.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, the identification and characterization of TLSs rely on immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining techniques, utilizing markers such as CD20 for B cells. Despite the specificity of IHC, Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining offers a more accessible and cost-effective choice. Capitalizing on the prevalence of H&E staining slides, we introduce a novel Mask-Guided Adversarial Transfer Learning method designed for virtual pathological staining. This method adeptly captures the nuanced color variations across diverse tissue types under various staining conditions, such as nucleus, red blood cells, positive reaction regions, without explicit label information, and adeptly synthesizes realistic IHC-like virtual staining patches, even replicating the positive reaction. Further, we propose the Virtual IHC Pathology Analysis Network (VIPA-Net), an integrated framework encompassing a Mask-Guided Transfer Module and an H&E-Based Virtual Staining TLS Detection Module. VIPA-Net synergistically harnesses both H\&E staining slides and the synthesized virtual IHC patches to enhance the detection of TLSs within H&E Whole Slide Images (WSIs). We evaluate the network with a comprehensive dataset comprising 1019 annotated slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Experimental results compellingly illustrate that the VIPA-Net substantially elevates TLS detection accuracy, effectively circumventing the need for actual CD20 staining across the public dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

However, the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of manual annotations present substantial challenges. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising weakly supervised learning approach for WSI classification. Recently research revealed employing pseudo bag augmentation can encourage models to learn various data, thus bolstering models' performance. While directly inheriting the parents' labels can introduce more noise by mislabeling in training. To address this issue, we translate the WSI classification task from weakly supervised learning to semi-weakly supervised learning, termed SWS-MIL, where adaptive pseudo bag augmentation (AdaPse) is employed to assign labeled and unlabeled data based on a threshold strategy. Using the "student-teacher" pattern, we introduce a feature augmentation technique, MergeUp, which merges bags with low-priority bags to enhance inter-category information, increasing training data diversity. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16, BRACS, and TCGA-LUNG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches, affirming its efficacy in WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce EXAONEPath, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. EXAONEPath is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs. Our experiments demonstrate that EXAONEPath significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared EXAONEPath with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that EXAONEPath achieves superior performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | License updated |

However, this paradigm relies on the use of a large number of labelled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases present significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with the pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI classification (FSWC) tasks. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC tasks. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multi-scale, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to get the WSI-level features. Based on two VLMs, extensive experiments and visualizations on three datasets demonstrated the powerful performance of our MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5tables</p></details> |

However, these assays are expensive, tissue destructive and often take weeks to complete. Using AI on routine H&E WSIs offers a fast and economical approach to screen for multiple molecular biomarkers. We present a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2, a foundation model pre-trained on 3 million slides, to interrogate genomic features previously determined by an next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, using 47,960 scanned hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSIs) from 38,984 cancer patients. Unlike traditional methods that train individual models for each biomarker or cancer type, our system employs a unified model to simultaneously predict a wide range of clinically relevant molecular biomarkers across cancer types. By training the network to replicate the MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel of 505 genes, it identified 80 high performing biomarkers with a mean AU-ROC of 0.89 in 15 most common cancer types. In addition, 40 biomarkers demonstrated strong associations with specific cancer histologic subtypes. Furthermore, 58 biomarkers were associated with targets frequently assayed clinically for therapy selection and response prediction. The model can also predict the activity of five canonical signaling pathways, identify defects in DNA repair mechanisms, and predict genomic instability measured by tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability (MSI), and chromosomal instability (CIN). The proposed model can offer potential to guide therapy selection, improve treatment efficacy, accelerate patient screening for clinical trials and provoke the interrogation of new therapeutic targets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data. This paper introduces the Hibou family of foundational vision transformers for pathology, leveraging the DINOv2 framework to pretrain two model variants, Hibou-B and Hibou-L, on a proprietary dataset of over 1 million whole slide images (WSIs) representing diverse tissue types and staining techniques. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance on both patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, Hibou-L achieves the highest average accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets.

| **[Attention Is Not What You Need: Revisiting Multi-Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09449v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although attention-based multi-instance learning algorithms have achieved impressive performances on slide-level whole slide image (WSI) classification tasks, they are prone to mistakenly focus on irrelevant patterns such as staining conditions and tissue morphology, leading to incorrect patch-level predictions and unreliable interpretability. Moreover, these attention-based MIL algorithms tend to focus on salient instances and struggle to recognize hard-to-classify instances. In this paper, we first demonstrate that attention-based WSI classification methods do not adhere to the standard MIL assumptions. From the standard MIL assumptions, we propose a surprisingly simple yet effective instance-based MIL method for WSI classification (FocusMIL) based on max-pooling and forward amortized variational inference. We argue that synergizing the standard MIL assumption with variational inference encourages the model to focus on tumour morphology instead of spurious correlations. Our experimental evaluations show that FocusMIL significantly outperforms the baselines in patch-level classification tasks on the Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC benchmarks. Visualization results show that our method also achieves better classification boundaries for identifying hard instances and mitigates the effect of spurious correlations between bags and labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[AEM: Attention Entropy Maximization for Multiple Instance Learning based Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15303v2)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has demonstrated effectiveness in analyzing whole slide images (WSIs), yet it often encounters overfitting challenges in real-world applications, particularly in the form of attention over-concentration. While existing methods to alleviate this issue introduce complex modules or processing steps, such as multiple-stage training and teacher-student distillation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective regularization: Attention Entropy Maximization (AEM). Motivated by our investigation revealing a positive correlation between attention entropy and model performance, AEM incorporates a negative entropy loss for attention values into the standard MIL framework, penalizing overly concentrated attention and encouraging the model to consider a broader range of informative regions in WSIs, potentially improving its generalization capabilities. Compared to existing overfitting mitigation methods, our AEM approach offers advantages of simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. It requires no additional modules or processing steps, involves only one hyperparameter, and demonstrates compatibility with MIL frameworks and techniques. These advantages make AEM particularly attractive for practical applications. We evaluate AEM on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over existing methods.

| **[HistoGym: A Reinforcement Learning Environment for Histopathological Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08847v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pathological research, education, and clinical practice, the decision-making process based on pathological images is critically important. This significance extends to digital pathology image analysis: its adequacy is demonstrated by the extensive information contained within tissue structures, which is essential for accurate cancer classification and grading. Additionally, its necessity is highlighted by the inherent requirement for interpretability in the conclusions generated by algorithms. For humans, determining tumor type and grade typically involves multi-scale analysis, which presents a significant challenge for AI algorithms. Traditional patch-based methods are inadequate for modeling such complex structures, as they fail to capture the intricate, multi-scale information inherent in whole slide images. Consequently, there is a pressing need for advanced AI techniques capable of efficiently and accurately replicating this complex analytical process. To address this issue, we introduce HistoGym, an open-source reinforcement learning environment for histopathological image analysis. Following OpenAI Gym APIs, HistoGym aims to foster whole slide image diagnosis by mimicking the real-life processes of doctors. Leveraging the pyramid feature of WSIs and the OpenSlide API, HistoGym provides a unified framework for various clinical tasks, including tumor detection and classification. We detail the observation, action, and reward specifications tailored for the histopathological image analysis domain and provide an open-source Python-based interface for both clinicians and researchers. To accommodate different clinical demands, we offer various scenarios for different organs and cancers, including both WSI-based and selected region-based scenarios, showcasing several noteworthy results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive uncertainty estimation in deep learning for lung carcinoma classification in digital pathology under real dataset shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08432v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has shown tremendous progress in a wide range of digital pathology and medical image classification tasks. Its integration into safe clinical decision-making support requires robust and reliable models. However, real-world data comes with diversities that often lie outside the intended source distribution. Moreover, when test samples are dramatically different, clinical decision-making is greatly affected. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in models is crucial for well-calibrated predictions and determining when (or not) to trust a model. Unfortunately, many works have overlooked the importance of predictive uncertainty estimation. This paper evaluates whether predictive uncertainty estimation adds robustness to deep learning-based diagnostic decision-making systems. We investigate the effect of various carcinoma distribution shift scenarios on predictive performance and calibration. We first systematically investigate three popular methods for improving predictive uncertainty: Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensemble, and few-shot learning on lung adenocarcinoma classification as a primary disease in whole slide images. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness of the methods in terms of performance and calibration under clinically relevant distribution shifts such as in-distribution shifts comprising primary disease sub-types and other characterization analysis data; out-of-distribution shifts comprising well-differentiated cases, different organ origin, and imaging modality shifts. While studies on uncertainty estimation exist, to our best knowledge, no rigorous large-scale benchmark compares predictive uncertainty estimation including these dataset shifts for lung carcinoma classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</p></details> |  |

However, current methods do not explicitly characterize distributional differences between patch sets within WSIs. We introduce HistoKernel, a novel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) kernel that measures distributional similarity between WSIs for enhanced prediction performance on downstream prediction tasks. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates HistoKernel's effectiveness across various machine learning tasks, including retrieval (n = 9,362), drug sensitivity regression (n = 551), point mutation classification (n = 3,419), and survival analysis (n = 2,291), outperforming existing deep learning methods. Additionally, HistoKernel seamlessly integrates multi-modal data and offers a novel perturbation-based method for patch-level explainability. This work pioneers the use of kernel-based methods for WSI-level predictive modeling, opening new avenues for research.

| **[Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning: Developing an Instance-Level Classifier via Weakly-Supervised Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04813v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) problem is currently solved from either bag-classification or instance-classification perspective, both of which ignore important information contained in some instances and result in limited performance. For example, existing methods often face difficulty in learning hard positive instances. In this paper, we formulate MIL as a semi-supervised instance classification problem, so that all the labeled and unlabeled instances can be fully utilized to train a better classifier. The difficulty in this formulation is that all the labeled instances are negative in MIL, and traditional self-training techniques used in semi-supervised learning tend to degenerate in generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled instances in this scenario. To resolve this problem, we propose a weakly-supervised self-training method, in which we utilize the positive bag labels to construct a global constraint and a local constraint on the pseudo labels to prevent them from degenerating and force the classifier to learn hard positive instances. It is worth noting that easy positive instances are instances are far from the decision boundary in the classification process, while hard positive instances are those close to the decision boundary. Through iterative optimization, the pseudo labels can gradually approach the true labels. Extensive experiments on two MNIST synthetic datasets, five traditional MIL benchmark datasets and two histopathology whole slide image datasets show that our method achieved new SOTA performance on all of them. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multistain Pretraining for Slide Representation Learning in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02859v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing self-supervised learning (SSL) models that can learn universal and transferable representations of H&E gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is becoming increasingly valuable in computational pathology. These models hold the potential to advance critical tasks such as few-shot classification, slide retrieval, and patient stratification. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from small images (e.g., 224 x 224 patches) to entire slides, usually by aligning two different augmentations (or views) of the slide. Yet the resulting representation remains constrained by the limited clinical and biological diversity of the views. Instead, we postulate that slides stained with multiple markers, such as immunohistochemistry, can be used as different views to form a rich task-agnostic training signal. To this end, we introduce Madeleine, a multimodal pretraining strategy for slide representation learning. Madeleine is trained with a dual global-local cross-stain alignment objective on large cohorts of breast cancer samples (N=4,211 WSIs across five stains) and kidney transplant samples (N=12,070 WSIs across four stains). We demonstrate the quality of slide representations learned by Madeleine on various downstream evaluations, ranging from morphological and molecular classification to prognostic prediction, comprising 21 tasks using 7,299 WSIs from multiple medical centers.

| **[PathoDuet: Foundation Models for Pathological Slide Analysis of H&E and IHC Stains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09894v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large amounts of digitized histopathological data display a promising future for developing pathological foundation models via self-supervised learning methods. Foundation models pretrained with these methods serve as a good basis for downstream tasks. However, the gap between natural and histopathological images hinders the direct application of existing methods. In this work, we present PathoDuet, a series of pretrained models on histopathological images, and a new self-supervised learning framework in histopathology. The framework is featured by a newly-introduced pretext token and later task raisers to explicitly utilize certain relations between images, like multiple magnifications and multiple stains. Based on this, two pretext tasks, cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring, are designed to pretrain the model on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images and transfer the model to immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, respectively. To validate the efficacy of our models, we evaluate the performance over a wide variety of downstream tasks, including patch-level colorectal cancer subtyping and whole slide image (WSI)-level classification in H&E field, together with expression level prediction of IHC marker, tumor identification and slide-level qualitative analysis in IHC field. The experimental results show the superiority of our models over most tasks and the efficacy of proposed pretext tasks.

| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |
| **[The Importance of Downstream Networks in Digital Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a static downstream aggregation model setup, encompassing a fixed architecture and hyperparameters, a practice we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a sensitivity of feature extractor models towards aggregation model configurations, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen configurations. By accounting for this sensitivity, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the feature extractors' sensitivity to various aggregation model configurations, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of new foundation models in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SC-MIL: Sparsely Coded Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00048v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely used in weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification. Typical MIL methods include a feature embedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained feature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into predictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This involves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training as well as modeling the correlations between instances separately. In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that addresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary learning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances by expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete dictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings by suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To make the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we unrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling. The proposed SC module can be incorporated into any existing MIL framework in a plug-and-play manner with an acceptable computational cost. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed SC module could substantially boost the performance of state-of-the-art MIL methods.

We aim to bridge the gap between imaging and genomics data by leveraging transformer networks, allowing for accurate genomic profile predictions from CT/MRI images. Presently most studies rely on the use of whole slide images (WSI) for the association, which are obtained via invasive methodologies. We propose using only available CT/MRI images to predict genomic sequences. Our transformer based approach is able to efficiently generate associations between multiple sequences based on CT/MRI images alone. This work paves the way for the use of non-invasive imaging modalities for precise and personalized healthcare, allowing for a better understanding of diseases and treatment.</p></details> |  |
| **[MicroMIL: Graph-based Contextual Multiple Instance Learning for Patient Diagnosis Using Microscopy Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21604v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current histopathology research has primarily focused on using whole-slide images (WSIs) produced by scanners with weakly-supervised multiple instance learning (MIL). However, WSIs are costly, memory-intensive, and require extensive analysis time. As an alternative, microscopy-based analysis offers cost and memory efficiency, though microscopy images face issues with unknown absolute positions and redundant images due to multiple captures from the subjective perspectives of pathologists. To this end, we introduce MicroMIL, a weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically built to address these challenges by dynamically clustering images using deep cluster embedding (DCE) and Gumbel Softmax for representative image extraction. Graph edges are then constructed from the upper triangular similarity matrix, with nodes connected to their most similar neighbors, and a graph neural network (GNN) is utilized to capture local and diverse areas of contextual information. Unlike existing graph-based MIL methods designed for WSIs that require absolute positions, MicroMIL efficiently handles the graph edges without this need. Extensive evaluations on real-world colon cancer (Seegene) and public BreakHis datasets demonstrate that MicroMIL outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for patient diagnosis using microscopy images.

While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p < 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</p></details> |  |

Early screening via cytology Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis is critical to prevent this Cancer progression and improve survival rate, but pathologist's single test suffers inevitable false negative due to the immense number of cells that need to be reviewed within a WSI. Though computer-aided automated diagnostic models can serve as strong complement for pathologists, their effectiveness is hampered by the paucity of extensive and detailed annotations, coupled with the limited interpretability and robustness. These factors significantly hinder their practical applicability and reliability in clinical settings. To tackle these challenges, we develop an AI approach, which is a Scalable Technology for Robust and Interpretable Diagnosis built on Extensive data (STRIDE) of cervical cytology. STRIDE addresses the bottleneck of limited annotations by integrating patient-level labels with a small portion of cell-level labels through an end-to-end training strategy, facilitating scalable learning across extensive datasets. To further improve the robustness to real-world domain shifts of cytology slide-making and imaging, STRIDE employs color adversarial samples training that mimic staining and imaging variations. Lastly, to achieve pathologist-level interpretability for the trustworthiness in clinical settings, STRIDE can generate explanatory textual descriptions that simulates pathologists' diagnostic processes by cell image feature and textual description alignment. Conducting extensive experiments and evaluations in 183 medical centers with a dataset of 341,889 WSIs and 0.1 billion cells from cervical cytology patients, STRIDE has demonstrated a remarkable superiority over previous state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Cell Nuclei Instance Segmentation and Classification: Leveraging Context and Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18673v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manually annotating nuclei from the gigapixel Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is a laborious and costly task, meaning automated algorithms for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification could alleviate the workload of pathologists and clinical researchers and at the same time facilitate the automatic extraction of clinically interpretable features. But due to high intra- and inter-class variability of nuclei morphological and chromatic features, as well as H&E-stains susceptibility to artefacts, state-of-the-art algorithms cannot correctly detect and classify instances with the necessary performance. In this work, we hypothesise context and attention inductive biases in artificial neural networks (ANNs) could increase the generalization of algorithms for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification. We conduct a thorough survey on context and attention methods for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification from H&E-stained microscopy imaging, while providing a comprehensive discussion of the challenges being tackled with context and attention. Besides, we illustrate some limitations of current approaches and present ideas for future research. As a case study, we extend both a general instance segmentation and classification method (Mask-RCNN) and a tailored cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification model (HoVer-Net) with context- and attention-based mechanisms, and do a comparative analysis on a multi-centre colon nuclei identification and counting dataset. Although pathologists rely on context at multiple levels while paying attention to specific Regions of Interest (RoIs) when analysing and annotating WSIs, our findings suggest translating that domain knowledge into algorithm design is no trivial task, but to fully exploit these mechanisms, the scientific understanding of these methods should be addressed.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce SPIDER (Supervised Pathology Image-DEscription Repository), the largest publicly available patch-level dataset covering multiple organ types, including Skin, Colorectal, and Thorax, with comprehensive class coverage for each organ. SPIDER provides high-quality annotations verified by expert pathologists and includes surrounding context patches, which enhance classification performance by providing spatial context. Alongside the dataset, we present baseline models trained on SPIDER using the Hibou-L foundation model as a feature extractor combined with an attention-based classification head. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple tissue categories and serve as strong benchmarks for future digital pathology research. Beyond patch classification, the model enables rapid identification of significant areas, quantitative tissue metrics, and establishes a foundation for multimodal approaches. Both the dataset and trained models are publicly available to advance research, reproducibility, and AI-driven pathology development.

| **[Foundation Models -- A Panacea for Artificial Intelligence in Pathology?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21264v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948; updated authors list format</p></details> |

To address this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance learning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance pre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In addition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based Kolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the performance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |

Using the TORGO dataset, we address data scarcity and privacy challenges in speech-language pathology. Our contributions include demonstrating that voice cloning preserves dysarthric speech characteristics, analyzing differences between real and synthetic data, and discussing implications for diagnostics, rehabilitation, and communication. We cloned voices from dysarthric and control speakers using a commercial platform, ensuring gender-matched synthetic voices. A licensed speech-language pathologist (SLP) evaluated a subset for dysarthria, speaker gender, and synthetic indicators. The SLP correctly identified dysarthria in all cases and speaker gender in 95% but misclassified 30% of synthetic samples as real, indicating high realism. Our results suggest synthetic speech effectively captures disordered characteristics and that voice cloning has advanced to produce high-quality data resembling real speech, even to trained professionals. This has critical implications for healthcare, where synthetic data can mitigate data scarcity, protect privacy, and enhance AI-driven diagnostics. By enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality speech datasets, voice cloning can improve generalizable models, personalize therapy, and advance assistive technologies for dysarthria. We publicly release our synthetic dataset to foster further research and collaboration, aiming to develop robust models that improve patient outcomes in speech-language pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in the field of pathology, particularly for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured medical texts such as pathology reports, remains underexplored and not well quantified. In this project, we leverage state-of-the-art language models, including the GPT family, Mistral models, and the open-source Llama models, to evaluate their performance in comprehensively analyzing pathology reports. Specifically, we assess their performance in cancer type identification, AJCC stage determination, and prognosis assessment, encompassing both information extraction and higher-order reasoning tasks. Based on a detailed analysis of their performance metrics in a zero-shot setting, we developed two instruction-tuned models: Path-llama3.1-8B and Path-GPT-4o-mini-FT. These models demonstrated superior performance in zero-shot cancer type identification, staging, and prognosis assessment compared to the other models evaluated.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Shazam, a novel framework designed to efficiently combine multiple CPath models. Unlike previous approaches that train a fixed-parameter FM, Shazam dynamically extracts and refines information from diverse FMs for each specific task. To ensure that each FM contributes effectively without dominance, a novel distillation strategy is applied, guiding the student model with features from all teacher models, which enhances its generalization ability. Experimental results on two pathology patch classification datasets demonstrate that Shazam outperforms existing CPath models and other fusion methods. Its lightweight, flexible design makes it a promising solution for improving CPath analysis in real-world settings. Code will be available at https://github.com/Tuner12/Shazam.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prompting Medical Large Vision-Language Models to Diagnose Pathologies by Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21368v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years, and they have been extended to the medical domain. Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling foundation models for robust and efficient models in digital pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16239v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the advent of foundation models (FM) for digital pathology has relied heavily on scaling the pre-training datasets and the model size, yielding large and powerful models. While it resulted in improving the performance on diverse downstream tasks, it also introduced increased computational cost and inference time. In this work, we explore the distillation of a large foundation model into a smaller one, reducing the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. Leveraging distillation techniques, our distilled model, H0-mini, achieves nearly comparable performance to large FMs at a significantly reduced inference cost. It is evaluated on several public benchmarks, achieving 3rd place on the HEST benchmark and 5th place on the EVA benchmark. Additionally, a robustness analysis conducted on the PLISM dataset demonstrates that our distilled model reaches excellent robustness to variations in staining and scanning conditions, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art models. This opens new perspectives to design lightweight and robust models for digital pathology, without compromising on performance.</p></details> | Preprint |

Cellular nuclei segmentation can segment various types of cells for downstream analysis, but it relies on predefined categories and lacks flexibility. Moreover, pathology visual question answering can perform image-level understanding but lacks region-level detection capability. To address this, we propose a new benchmark called Pathology Visual Grounding (PathVG), which aims to detect regions based on expressions with different attributes. To evaluate PathVG, we create a new dataset named RefPath which contains 27,610 images with 33,500 language-grounded boxes. Compared to visual grounding in other domains, PathVG presents pathological images at multi-scale and contains expressions with pathological knowledge. In the experimental study, we found that the biggest challenge was the implicit information underlying the pathological expressions. Based on this, we proposed Pathology Knowledge-enhanced Network (PKNet) as the baseline model for PathVG. PKNet leverages the knowledge-enhancement capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert pathological terms with implicit information into explicit visual features, and fuses knowledge features with expression features through the designed Knowledge Fusion Module (KFM). The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PathVG benchmark.</p></details> | 10pages, 4figures |

Recent advances in domain generalization improve model transferability in terms of aggregated performance measured by the Area Under Curve (AUC). However, clinical regulations often require to control the transferability of other metrics, such as prescribed sensitivity levels. We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Validated across multiple cohorts and tasks, our method enables robust sensitivity control with only a handful of calibration samples, providing a practical solution for reliable deployment of computational pathology systems.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Can We Simplify Slide-level Fine-tuning of Pathology Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20823v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed histopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis being a core application. Traditionally, weakly supervised fine-tuning via multiple instance learning (MIL) has been the primary method for adapting foundation models to WSIs. However, in this work we present a key experimental finding: a simple nonlinear mapping strategy combining mean pooling and a multilayer perceptron, called SiMLP, can effectively adapt patch-level foundation models to slide-level tasks without complex MIL-based learning. Through extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of SiMLP with state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on a large-scale pan-cancer classification task, SiMLP surpasses popular MIL-based methods by 3.52%. Furthermore, SiMLP shows strong learning ability in few-shot classification and remaining highly competitive with slide-level foundation models pretrained on tens of thousands of slides. Finally, SiMLP exhibits remarkable robustness and transferability in lung cancer subtyping. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional MIL-based fine-tuning paradigm, demonstrating that a task-agnostic representation strategy alone can effectively adapt foundation models to WSI analysis. These insights offer a unique and meaningful perspective for future research in digital pathology, paving the way for more efficient and broadly applicable methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study. While report generation revealed to be more difficult for rare melanocytic lesion subtypes, the cross-modal retrieval performance for these cases was considerably better.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.19285</p></details> |

Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Automatic Content-Aware Tiling Pipeline for Pathology Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16885v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the use of deep learning (DL) methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced computational pathology, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Whole Slide Images (WSI) plays a crucial role by providing detailed tissue samples for the analysis and training of DL models. However, WSIs often contain regions with artifacts such as tissue folds, blurring, as well as non-tissue regions (background), which can negatively impact DL model performance. These artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant and can lead to inaccurate results. This paper proposes a fully automatic supervised DL pipeline for WSI Quality Assessment (WSI-QA) that uses a fused model combining CNNs and ViTs to detect and exclude WSI regions with artifacts, ensuring that only qualified WSI regions are used to build DL-based computational pathology applications. The proposed pipeline employs a pixel-based segmentation model to classify WSI regions as either qualified or non-qualified based on the presence of artifacts. The proposed model was trained on a large and diverse dataset and validated with internal and external data from various human organs, scanners, and H&E staining procedures. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WSI artifact detection. The proposed model consistently achieved over 95% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across all artifact types. Furthermore, the WSI-QA pipeline shows strong generalization across different tissue types and scanning conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis journal, February 2025</p></details> |

PFMs have simplified the development of deep learning models, effectively leveraging prior knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy in diverse scenarios. However, we find that PFMs sometimes struggle with certain challenges. Specifically, features extracted by PFMs are often contaminated by diagnosis-irrelevant information, i.e., institution-specific features associated with the images. This contamination can lead to spurious correlations, undermining the models' generalization ability when applied in real-world clinical settings. In this work, we first reveal the issue of feature contamination in PFMs, demonstrate the presence of institution-specific features, thoroughly investigate its negative impacts, analyze the underlying causes, and provide insights into potential solutions. Specifically, we find that institution-specific information is embedded in pathological images and can be readily captured by current PFMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the detrimental impact of this irrelevant information, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, where reliance on contaminated features leads to significant performance degradation. This indicates that the models are being misled by non-diagnostic information. We further delve into the reasons PFMs extract such institution-specific information and validate our findings. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate the influence of irrelevant information. This study is not intended to criticize existing PFMs, as they have indeed greatly advanced the development of computational pathology. our aim is to inspire future research to focus on innovative training strategies, rather than relying exclusively on scaling laws, to realize more generalized PFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages,1 figure,14 tables</p></details> |

The key innovation lies in RMA-Mamba's ability to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining precise local feature representation through its hierarchical processing pipeline. By integrating Vision Mamba (VMamba)'s efficient sequence modeling with RMA's targeted feature refinement, our architecture achieves superior feature learning across multiple scales. This dual-mechanism approach enables robust handling of complex morphological patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate RMA-Mamba's effectiveness in the challenging domain of pathological liver segmentation (from both CT and MRI), where traditional segmentation approaches often fail due to tissue variations. When evaluated on a newly introduced cirrhotic liver dataset (CirrMRI600+) of T2-weighted MRI scans, RMA-Mamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance with a Dice coefficient of 92.08%, mean IoU of 87.36%, and recall of 92.96%. The architecture's generalizability is further validated on the cancerous liver segmentation from CT scans (LiTS: Liver Tumor Segmentation dataset), yielding a Dice score of 92.9% and mIoU of 88.99%.

In recent years, the development of machine learning and deep learning has greatly bolstered the power of computational pathology. However, there still remains the issue of data scarcity and data imbalance, which can have an adversarial effect on any computational method. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and effective data augmentation strategy to generate new pathology images from the existing pathology images and thus enrich datasets without additional data collection or annotation costs. To evaluate the proposed method, we employed two sets of colorectal cancer datasets and obtained improved classification results, suggesting that the proposed simple approach holds the potential for alleviating the data scarcity and imbalance in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation emerges as a crucial technique to mitigate this limitation. In this study, we introduce an efficient data augmentation method for pathology images, called USegMix. Given a set of pathology images, the proposed method generates a new, synthetic image in two phases. In the first phase, USegMix constructs a pool of tissue segments in an automated and unsupervised manner using superpixels and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In the second phase, USegMix selects a candidate segment in a target image, replaces it with a similar segment from the segment pool, and blends them by using a pre-trained diffusion model. In this way, USegMix can generate diverse and realistic pathology images. We rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of USegMix on two pathology image datasets of colorectal and prostate cancers. The results demonstrate improvements in cancer classification performance, underscoring the substantial potential of USegMix for pathology image analysis.</p></details> |  |

Although artificial intelligence models show promise in this domain, their clinical adoption is limited by the lack of medically grounded guidance during training, often resulting in non-explainable intrinsic predictions. To address this, we propose Doctor-in-the-Loop, a novel framework that integrates expert-driven domain knowledge with explainable artificial intelligence techniques, directing the model toward clinically relevant anatomical regions and improving both interpretability and trustworthiness. Our approach employs a gradual multi-view strategy, progressively refining the model's focus from broad contextual features to finer, lesion-specific details. By incorporating domain insights at every stage, we enhance predictive accuracy while ensuring that the model's decision-making process aligns more closely with clinical reasoning. Evaluated on a dataset of NSCLC patients, Doctor-in-the-Loop delivers promising predictive performance and provides transparent, justifiable outputs, representing a significant step toward clinically explainable artificial intelligence in oncology.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods are computationally inefficient, processing thousands of redundant tiles per WSI and requiring complex aggregator models. We introduce EAGLE (Efficient Approach for Guided Local Examination), a deep learning framework that emulates pathologists by selectively analyzing informative regions. EAGLE incorporates two foundation models: CHIEF for efficient tile selection and Virchow2 for extracting high-quality features. Benchmarking was conducted against leading slide- and tile-level foundation models across 31 tasks from four cancer types, spanning morphology, biomarker prediction and prognosis. EAGLE outperformed state-of-the-art foundation models by up to 23% and achieved the highest AUROC overall. It processed a slide in 2.27 seconds, reducing computational time by more than 99% compared to existing models. This efficiency enables real-time workflows, allows pathologists to validate all tiles which are used by the model during analysis, and eliminates dependence on high-performance computing, making AI-powered pathology more accessible. By reliably identifying meaningful regions and minimizing artifacts, EAGLE provides robust and interpretable outputs, supporting rapid slide searches, integration into multi-omics pipelines and emerging clinical foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging large language models for structured information extraction from pathology reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12183v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Structured information extraction from unstructured histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research. Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to manual extraction by a trained human annotator. Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family, which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111 histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study, extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary. Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama 3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106, respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p <0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for self-hosting. Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for structured information extraction that can be customized by non-programmers using natural language. Its modular design enables reuse for various extraction tasks, producing standardized, structured data from unstructured text reports to facilitate analytics through improved accessibility and interoperability.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[SEW: Self-calibration Enhanced Whole Slide Pathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10853v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology images are considered the ``gold standard" for cancer diagnosis and treatment, with gigapixel images providing extensive tissue and cellular information. Existing methods fail to simultaneously extract global structural and local detail features for comprehensive pathology image analysis efficiently. To address these limitations, we propose a self-calibration enhanced framework for whole slide pathology image analysis, comprising three components: a global branch, a focus predictor, and a detailed branch. The global branch initially classifies using the pathological thumbnail, while the focus predictor identifies relevant regions for classification based on the last layer features of the global branch. The detailed extraction branch then assesses whether the magnified regions correspond to the lesion area. Finally, a feature consistency constraint between the global and detail branches ensures that the global branch focuses on the appropriate region and extracts sufficient discriminative features for final identification. These focused discriminative features prove invaluable for uncovering novel prognostic tumor markers from the perspective of feature cluster uniqueness and tissue spatial distribution. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed framework can rapidly deliver accurate and explainable results for pathological grading and prognosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

This study leverages machine learning and deep learning approaches, along with feature selection and extraction methods, to enhance PCa pathological staging predictions using RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Gene expression profiles from 486 tumors were analyzed using advanced algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of the study is measured with respect to the F1-score, as well as precision and recall, all of which are calculated as weighted averages. The results reveal that the highest test F1-score, approximately 83%, was achieved by the Random Forest algorithm, followed by Logistic Regression at 80%, while both Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) scored around 79%. Furthermore, deep learning models with data augmentation achieved an accuracy of 71. 23%, while PCA-based dimensionality reduction reached an accuracy of 69.86%. This research highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in clinical oncology, paving the way for more reliable diagnostic tools that can ultimately improve patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Generative AI "co-pilots" now demonstrate the ability to mine subtle, sub-visual tissue cues across the cellular-to-pathology spectrum, generate comprehensive reports, and respond to complex user queries. The scale of data has surged dramatically, growing from tens to millions of multi-gigapixel tissue images, while the number of trainable parameters in these models has risen to several billion. The critical question remains: how will this new wave of generative and multi-purpose AI transform clinical diagnostics? In this article, we explore the true potential of these innovations and their integration into clinical practice. We review the rapid progress of foundation models in pathology, clarify their applications and significance. More precisely, we examine the very definition of foundational models, identifying what makes them foundational, general, or multipurpose, and assess their impact on computational pathology. Additionally, we address the unique challenges associated with their development and evaluation. These models have demonstrated exceptional predictive and generative capabilities, but establishing global benchmarks is crucial to enhancing evaluation standards and fostering their widespread clinical adoption. In computational pathology, the broader impact of frontier AI ultimately depends on widespread adoption and societal acceptance. While direct public exposure is not strictly necessary, it remains a powerful tool for dispelling misconceptions, building trust, and securing regulatory support.</p></details> | 63 pages, 7 figures |

To address this, we frame pathology segmentation as an unsupervised visual anomaly segmentation (UVAS) problem, leveraging the inherent rarity of pathological patterns compared to healthy ones. We enhance the existing density-based UVAS framework with two key innovations: (1) dense self-supervised learning (SSL) for feature extraction, eliminating the need for supervised pre-training, and (2) learned, masking-invariant dense features as conditioning variables, replacing hand-crafted positional encodings. Trained on over 30,000 unlabeled 3D CT volumes, our model, Screener, outperforms existing UVAS methods on four large-scale test datasets comprising 1,820 scans with diverse pathologies. Code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Vision-Language Survival Analysis with Ordinal Inductive Bias for Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09369v4)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) provide an important tool to assess cancer prognosis in computational pathology (CPATH). While existing survival analysis (SA) approaches have made exciting progress, they are generally limited to adopting highly-expressive network architectures and only coarse-grained patient-level labels to learn visual prognostic representations from gigapixel WSIs. Such learning paradigm suffers from critical performance bottlenecks, when facing present scarce training data and standard multi-instance learning (MIL) framework in CPATH. To overcome it, this paper, for the first time, proposes a new Vision-Language-based SA (VLSA) paradigm. Concretely, (1) VLSA is driven by pathology VL foundation models. It no longer relies on high-capability networks and shows the advantage of data efficiency. (2) In vision-end, VLSA encodes textual prognostic prior and then employs it as auxiliary signals to guide the aggregating of visual prognostic features at instance level, thereby compensating for the weak supervision in MIL. Moreover, given the characteristics of SA, we propose i) ordinal survival prompt learning to transform continuous survival labels into textual prompts; and ii) ordinal incidence function as prediction target to make SA compatible with VL-based prediction. Notably, VLSA's predictions can be interpreted intuitively by our Shapley values-based method. The extensive experiments on five datasets confirm the effectiveness of our scheme. Our VLSA could pave a new way for SA in CPATH by offering weakly-supervised MIL an effective means to learn valuable prognostic clues from gigapixel WSIs.

| **[MLLM4PUE: Toward Universal Embeddings in Computational Pathology through Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07221v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology plays a critical role in diagnosing a wide range of diseases, yet existing approaches often rely heavily on task-specific models trained on extensive, well-labeled datasets. These methods face sustainability challenges due to the diversity of pathologies and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. To address these limitations, we highlight the need for universal multimodal embeddings that can support multiple downstream tasks. Previous approaches often involve fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which handle images and text separately, limiting their ability to capture complex multimodal relationships. Additionally, these models are evaluated across diverse datasets without a unified benchmark for assessing multimodal embeddings in pathology. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM4PUE, a novel framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate Pathology Universal Embeddings. The MLLM4PUE framework not only facilitates robust integration of images and text but also enhances understanding and fusion capabilities across various tasks. We further introduce the Pathology Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (PMEB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the quality of pathology multimodal embeddings. PMEB comprises 15 original tasks drawn from 14 datasets, organized into three meta-tasks: retrieval, classification, and composed retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MLLM4PUE, illustrating MLLM-based models can effectively support a wide range of downstream tasks and unify the research direction for foundation models in pathology.</p></details> |  |

We anticipate that these resources will promote transparency, reproducibility, and continued progress in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLAM: Glomeruli Segmentation for Human Pathological Lesions using Adapted Mouse Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18390v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving from animal models to human applications in preclinical research encompasses a broad spectrum of disciplines in medical science. A fundamental element in the development of new drugs, treatments, diagnostic methods, and in deepening our understanding of disease processes is the accurate measurement of kidney tissues. Past studies have demonstrated the viability of translating glomeruli segmentation techniques from mouse models to human applications. Yet, these investigations tend to neglect the complexities involved in segmenting pathological glomeruli affected by different lesions. Such lesions present a wider range of morphological variations compared to healthy glomerular tissue, which are arguably more valuable than normal glomeruli in clinical practice. Furthermore, data on lesions from animal models can be more readily scaled up from disease models and whole kidney biopsies. This brings up a question: ``\textit{Can a pathological segmentation model trained on mouse models be effectively applied to human patients?}" To answer this question, we introduced GLAM, a deep learning study for fine-grained segmentation of human kidney lesions using a mouse model, addressing mouse-to-human transfer learning, by evaluating different learning strategies for segmenting human pathological lesions using zero-shot transfer learning and hybrid learning by leveraging mouse samples. From the results, the hybrid learning model achieved superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are the Majority of Public Computational Notebooks Pathologically Non-Executable?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04184v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks are the de facto platforms for exploratory data science, offering an interactive programming environment where users can create, modify, and execute code cells in any sequence. However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |

Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate six machine learning (ML) classifiers - support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost - using grid search for feasible hyperparameters of selected classifiers and 20480 different feature subsets. Top 1000 classifier-feature subset combinations for each classifier type are validated with repeated stratified cross-validation. To address class imbalance, we apply K-Means SMOTE to augment the training data. Our approach achieves outstanding performance, reaching 85.61%, 84.69% and 85.22% unweighted average recall (UAR) for females, males and combined results respectivelly. We intentionally omit accuracy as it is a highly biased metric for imbalanced data. This advancement demonstrates significant potential for clinical deployment of ML methods, offering a valuable supportive tool for an objective examination of voice pathologies. To enable an easier use of our methodology and to support our claims, we provide a publicly available GitHub repository with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.13771573.

| **[Current Pathology Foundation Models are unrobust to Medical Center Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18055v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) hold great promise for healthcare. Before they can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are robust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs focus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known confounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and other differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness metric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding features. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find that all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical center to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are observed. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one, meaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A quantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on FM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of unrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that cancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable to same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical center. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly organized by medical centers than by biological factors. As a consequence, the medical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source and cancer type. The robustness index introduced here is provided with the aim of advancing progress towards clinical adoption of robust and reliable pathology FMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathological MRI Segmentation by Synthetic Pathological Data Generation in Fetuses and Neonates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19338v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing new methods for the automated analysis of clinical fetal and neonatal MRI data is limited by the scarcity of annotated pathological datasets and privacy concerns that often restrict data sharing, hindering the effectiveness of deep learning models. We address this in two ways. First, we introduce Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, a novel diffusion model framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic pathological fetal and neonatal MRIs from semantic label images. Second, we enhance training data by modifying healthy label images through morphological alterations to simulate conditions such as ventriculomegaly, cerebellar and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and microcephaly. By leveraging Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, we synthesize realistic pathological MRIs from these modified pathological label images. Radiologists rated the synthetic MRIs as significantly (p < 0.05) superior in quality and diagnostic value compared to real MRIs, demonstrating features such as blood vessels and choroid plexus, and improved alignment with label annotations. Synthetic pathological data enhanced state-of-the-art nnUNet segmentation performance, particularly for severe ventriculomegaly cases, with the greatest improvements achieved in ventricle segmentation (Dice scores: 0.9253 vs. 0.7317). This study underscores the potential of generative AI as transformative tool for data augmentation, offering improved segmentation performance in pathological cases. This development represents a significant step towards improving analysis and segmentation accuracy in prenatal imaging, and also offers new ways for data anonymization through the generation of pathologic image data.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This paper pioneers EEG-language models (ELMs) trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We propose to combine multimodal alignment in this novel domain with timeseries cropping and text segmentation, enabling an extension based on multiple instance learning to alleviate misalignment between irrelevant EEG or text segments. Our multimodal models significantly improve pathology detection compared to EEG-only models across four evaluations and for the first time enable zero-shot classification as well as retrieval of both neural signals and reports. In sum, these results highlight the potential of ELMs, representing significant progress for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence of color correction on pathology detection in Capsule Endoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00076v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) using deep learning has been explored in the recent past. However, deep learning models can be influenced by the color quality of the dataset used to train them, impacting detection, segmentation and classification tasks. In this work, we evaluate the impact of color correction on pathology detection using two prominent object detection models: Retinanet and YOLOv5. We first generate two color corrected versions of a popular WCE dataset (i.e., SEE-AI dataset) using two different color correction functions. We then evaluate the performance of the Retinanet and YOLOv5 on the original and color corrected versions of the dataset. The results reveal that color correction makes the models generate larger bounding boxes and larger intersection areas with the ground truth annotations. Furthermore, color correction leads to an increased number of false positives for certain pathologies. However, these effects do not translate into a consistent improvement in performance metrics such as F1-scores, IoU, and AP50. The code is available at https://github.com/agossouema2011/WCE2024.

| **[Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[A two-stage dual-task learning strategy for early prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00051v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rationale and Objectives: Early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) can facilitate personalized treatment for breast cancer patients. To improve prediction accuracy at the early time point of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we proposed a two-stage dual-task learning strategy to train a deep neural network for early prediction of pCR using early-treatment magnetic resonance images. Methods: We developed and validated the two-stage dual-task learning strategy using the dataset from the national-wide, multi-institutional I-SPY2 clinical trial, which included dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images acquired at three time points: pretreatment (T0), after 3 weeks (T1), and after 12 weeks of treatment (T2). First, we trained a convolutional long short-term memory network to predict pCR and extract the latent space image features at T2. At the second stage, we trained a dual-task network to simultaneously predict pCR and the image features at T2 using images from T0 and T1. This allowed us to predict pCR earlier without using images from T2. Results: The conventional single-stage single-task strategy gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.799 for pCR prediction using all the data at time points T0 and T1. By using the proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy, the AUROC was improved to 0.820. Conclusions: The proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy can improve model performance significantly (p=0.0025) for predicting pCR at the early stage (3rd week) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The early prediction model can potentially help physicians to intervene early and develop personalized plans at the early stage of chemotherapy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular-driven Foundation Model for Oncologic Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16652v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are reshaping computational pathology by enabling transfer learning, where models pre-trained on vast datasets can be adapted for downstream diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic response tasks. Despite these advances, foundation models are still limited in their ability to encode the entire gigapixel whole-slide images without additional training and often lack complementary multimodal data. Here, we introduce Threads, a slide-level foundation model capable of generating universal representations of whole-slide images of any size. Threads was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse cohort of 47,171 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections, paired with corresponding genomic and transcriptomic profiles - the largest such paired dataset to be used for foundation model development to date. This unique training paradigm enables Threads to capture the tissue's underlying molecular composition, yielding powerful representations applicable to a wide array of downstream tasks. In extensive benchmarking across 54 oncology tasks, including clinical subtyping, grading, mutation prediction, immunohistochemistry status determination, treatment response prediction, and survival prediction, Threads outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and label efficiency. It is particularly well suited for predicting rare events, further emphasizing its clinical utility. We intend to make the model publicly available for the broader community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Self-Supervised Grading of Prostate Cancer Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15520v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prostate cancer grading using the ISUP system (International Society of Urological Pathology) for treatment decisions is highly subjective and requires considerable expertise. Despite advances in computer-aided diagnosis systems, few have handled efficient ISUP grading on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of prostate biopsies based only on slide-level labels. Some of the general challenges include managing gigapixel WSIs, obtaining patch-level annotations, and dealing with stain variability across centers. One of the main task-specific challenges faced by deep learning in ISUP grading, is the learning of patch-level features of Gleason patterns (GPs) based only on their slide labels. In this scenario, an efficient framework for ISUP grading is developed. The proposed TSOR is based on a novel Task-specific Self-supervised learning (SSL) model, which is fine-tuned using Ordinal Regression. Since the diversity of training samples plays a crucial role in SSL, a patch-level dataset is created to be relatively balanced w.r.t. the Gleason grades (GGs). This balanced dataset is used for pre-training, so that the model can effectively learn stain-agnostic features of the GP for better generalization. In medical image grading, it is desirable that misclassifications be as close as possible to the actual grade. From this perspective, the model is then fine-tuned for the task of ISUP grading using an ordinal regression-based approach. Experimental results on the most extensive multicenter prostate biopsies dataset (PANDA challenge), as well as the SICAP dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present a systematic evaluation of transfer learning strategies for brain tumor classification using these models. We analyzed 252 cases comprising five major tumor types: glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and metastatic tumors. Comparing state-of-the-art foundation models with conventional approaches, we found that foundation models demonstrated robust classification performance with as few as 10 patches per case, challenging the traditional assumption that extensive per-case image sampling is necessary. Furthermore, our evaluation revealed that simple transfer learning strategies like linear probing were sufficient, while fine-tuning often degraded model performance. These findings suggest a paradigm shift from extensive data collection to efficient utilization of pretrained features, providing practical implications for implementing AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical pathology.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

With the advancement of deep learning and computer vision, the automatic classification of breast tissue pathological images has emerged as a research focus. Existing methods typically rely on singular cell or tissue features and lack design considerations for morphological characteristics of challenging-to-classify categories, resulting in suboptimal classification performance. To address these problems, we proposes a novel breast cancer tissue classification model that Fused features of Edges, Cells, and Tissues (FECT), employing the ResMTUNet and an attention-based aggregator to extract and aggregate these features. Extensive testing on the BRACS dataset demonstrates that our model surpasses current advanced methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 scores. Moreover, due to its feature fusion that aligns with the diagnostic approach of pathologists, our model exhibits interpretability and holds promise for significant roles in future clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses this issue by leveraging a diffusion model for data augmentation applied during training an AI model. Our approach generates synthetic pathological tissue patches while preserving essential shape characteristics and intricate details specific to each tissue type. This method enhances the segmentation process by increasing the occurence of underrepresented classes in the training data.

Meanwhile, PathFiT performs seamless implementation across diverse pathology applications regardless of downstream specificity. To validate PathFiT, we construct a digital pathology benchmark with over 20 terabytes of Internet and real-world data comprising 28 H\&E-stained tasks and 7 specialized imaging tasks including Masson's Trichrome staining and immunofluorescence images. By applying PathFiT to the representative pathology foundation models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 34 out of 35 tasks, with significant improvements on 23 tasks and outperforming by 10.20% on specialized imaging tasks. The superior performance and versatility of PathFiT open up new avenues in computational pathology.</p></details> | 49 pages, 14 figures |

Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones along with patch-sampling for this task, which ignores the inherent multi-scale information embedded in the pyramidal data structure of digital pathology images, and wastes the inter-spot visual information crucial for accurate gene expression prediction. To address these limitations, we propose M2OST, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images via a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Unlike traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2OST uses multiple images from different levels of the digital pathology image to jointly predict the gene expressions in their common corresponding spot. Built upon our many-to-one scheme, M2OST can be easily scaled to fit different numbers of inputs, and its network structure inherently incorporates nearby inter-spot features, enhancing regression performance. We have tested M2OST on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2OST can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Impro...</summary><p>Improved from our previous unpublished work arXiv:2401.10608. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.10608</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Weak Supervision for Cell Localization in Digital Pathology Using Multitask Learning and Consistency Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15392v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell detection and segmentation are integral parts of automated systems in digital pathology. Encoder-decoder networks have emerged as a promising solution for these tasks. However, training of these networks has typically required full boundary annotations of cells, which are labor-intensive and difficult to obtain on a large scale. However, in many applications, such as cell counting, weaker forms of annotations--such as point annotations or approximate cell counts--can provide sufficient supervision for training. This study proposes a new mixed-supervision approach for training multitask networks in digital pathology by incorporating cell counts derived from the eyeballing process--a quick visual estimation method commonly used by pathologists. This study has two main contributions: (1) It proposes a mixed-supervision strategy for digital pathology that utilizes cell counts obtained by eyeballing as an auxiliary supervisory signal to train a multitask network for the first time. (2) This multitask network is designed to concurrently learn the tasks of cell counting and cell localization, and this study introduces a consistency loss that regularizes training by penalizing inconsistencies between the predictions of these two tasks. Our experiments on two datasets of hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue images demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively utilizes the weakest form of annotation, improving performance when stronger annotations are limited. These results highlight the potential of integrating eyeballing-derived ground truths into the network training, reducing the need for resource-intensive annotations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methodologies often struggle due to general models' insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge and privacy concerns associated with retrieval-based augmentation techniques. To address these issues, we propose a novel Vision-Language framework augmented with a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based datastore, which enhances the model's understanding by incorporating additional domain-specific medical knowledge essential for generating accurate and informative NLEs. Our framework employs a KG-based retrieval mechanism that not only improves the precision of the generated explanations but also preserves data privacy by avoiding direct data retrieval. The KG datastore is designed as a plug-and-play module, allowing for seamless integration with various model architectures. We introduce and evaluate three distinct frameworks within this paradigm: KG-LLaVA, which integrates the pre-trained LLaVA model with KG-RAG; Med-XPT, a custom framework combining MedCLIP, a transformer-based projector, and GPT-2; and Bio-LLaVA, which adapts LLaVA by incorporating the Bio-ViT-L vision model. These frameworks are validated on the MIMIC-NLE dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of KG augmentation in generating high-quality NLEs for thoracic pathologies.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

In practical medical scenarios, physicians and surgeons may lack the specialized expertise required for accurate X-ray interpretation, highlighting the need for machine vision to enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, conventional recognition techniques face challenges in discerning subtle differences in X-rays when classifying wrist pathologies, as many of these pathologies, such as fractures, can be small and hard to distinguish. This study tackles wrist pathology recognition as a fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) problem, utilizing a limited, custom-curated dataset that mirrors real-world medical constraints, relying solely on image-level annotations. We introduce a specialized FGVR-based ensemble approach to identify discriminative regions within X-rays. We employ an Explainable AI (XAI) technique called Grad-CAM to pinpoint these regions. Our ensemble approach outperformed many conventional SOTA and FGVR techniques, underscoring the effectiveness of our strategy in enhancing accuracy in wrist pathology recognition.</p></details> |  |

While current digital pathology solutions rely on lossy JPEG compression to address this issue, lossy compression can introduce color and texture disparities, potentially impacting clinical decision-making. While prior research addresses perceptual image quality and downstream performance independently of each other, we jointly evaluate compression schemes for perceptual and downstream task quality on four different datasets. In addition, we collect an initially uncompressed dataset for an unbiased perceptual evaluation of compression schemes. Our results show that deep learning models fine-tuned for perceptual quality outperform conventional compression schemes like JPEG-XL or WebP for further compression of WSI. However, they exhibit a significant bias towards the compression artifacts present in the training data and struggle to generalize across various compression schemes. We introduce a novel evaluation metric based on feature similarity between original files and compressed files that aligns very well with the actual downstream performance on the compressed WSI. Our metric allows for a general and standardized evaluation of lossy compression schemes and mitigates the requirement to independently assess different downstream tasks. Our study provides novel insights for the assessment of lossy compression schemes for WSI and encourages a unified evaluation of lossy compression schemes to accelerate the clinical uptake of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Knowledge-enhanced Pathology Vision-language Foundation Model for Cancer Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13126v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has enabled the development of highly robust foundation models for various pathological tasks across diverse diseases and patient cohorts. Among these models, vision-language pre-training, which leverages large-scale paired data to align pathology image and text embedding spaces, and provides a novel zero-shot paradigm for downstream tasks. However, existing models have been primarily data-driven and lack the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, which limits their performance in cancer diagnosis, especially for rare tumor subtypes. To address this limitation, we establish a Knowledge-enhanced Pathology (KEEP) foundation model that harnesses disease knowledge to facilitate vision-language pre-training. Specifically, we first construct a disease knowledge graph (KG) that covers 11,454 human diseases with 139,143 disease attributes, including synonyms, definitions, and hypernym relations. We then systematically reorganize the millions of publicly available noisy pathology image-text pairs, into 143K well-structured semantic groups linked through the hierarchical relations of the disease KG. To derive more nuanced image and text representations, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced vision-language pre-training approach that integrates disease knowledge into the alignment within hierarchical semantic groups instead of unstructured image-text pairs. Validated on 18 diverse benchmarks with more than 14,000 whole slide images (WSIs), KEEP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot cancer diagnostic tasks. Notably, for cancer detection, KEEP demonstrates an average sensitivity of 89.8% at a specificity of 95.0% across 7 cancer types. For cancer subtyping, KEEP achieves a median balanced accuracy of 0.456 in subtyping 30 rare brain cancers, indicating strong generalizability for diagnosing rare tumors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Embedding Aggregation Methods in Computational Pathology: A Clinical Data Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07841v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular self-supervised learning of foundation models (FMs), are revolutionizing medical imaging and computational pathology (CPath). A constant challenge in the analysis of digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is the problem of aggregating tens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings to a slide-level representation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for genomic research, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of these techniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequately explored. This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of ten slide-level aggregation techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks, including diagnostic assessment, biomarker classification, and outcome prediction. The results yield following key insights: (1) Embeddings derived from domain-specific (histological images) FMs outperform those from generic ImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware aggregators enhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained models but not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks and spatially-aware models do not show general superiority as it would be expected. These findings underscore the need for more adaptable and universally applicable aggregation techniques, guiding future research towards tools that better meet the evolving needs of clinical-AI in pathology.

Previous works on interpretability for machine learning models on pathology images have revolved around methods such as attention value visualization and deriving human-interpretable features from model heatmaps. Mechanistic interpretability is an emerging area of model interpretability that focuses on reverse-engineering neural networks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising direction in terms of extracting monosemantic features from polysemantic model activations. In this work, we trained a Sparse Autoencoder on the embeddings of a pathology pretrained foundation model. We found that Sparse Autoencoder features represent interpretable and monosemantic biological concepts. In particular, individual SAE dimensions showed strong correlations with cell type counts such as plasma cells and lymphocytes. These biological representations were unique to the pathology pretrained model and were not found in a self-supervised model pretrained on natural images. We demonstrated that such biologically-grounded monosemantic representations evolved across the model's depth, and the pathology foundation model eventually gained robustness to non-biological factors such as scanner type. The emergence of biologically relevant SAE features was generalizable to an out-of-domain dataset. Our work paves the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Previous research has primarily focused on separately training patch-level and whole-slide image (WSI)-level models, limiting the integration of learned knowledge across patches and WSIs, and resulting in redundant models. In this work, we introduce CPath-Omni, the first 15-billion-parameter LMM designed to unify both patch and WSI level image analysis, consolidating a variety of tasks at both levels, including classification, visual question answering, captioning, and visual referring prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPath-Omni achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across seven diverse tasks on 39 out of 42 datasets, outperforming or matching task-specific models trained for individual tasks. Additionally, we develop a specialized pathology CLIP-based visual processor for CPath-Omni, CPath-CLIP, which, for the first time, integrates different vision models and incorporates a large language model as a text encoder to build a more powerful CLIP model, which achieves SOTA performance on nine zero-shot and four few-shot datasets. Our findings highlight CPath-Omni's ability to unify diverse pathology tasks, demonstrating its potential to streamline and advance the field of foundation model in pathology.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

However, the invariance of these representations to patch rotation remains unexplored. This study investigates the rotational invariance of latent representations across twelve foundation models by quantifying the alignment between non-rotated and rotated patches using mutual $k$-nearest neighbours and cosine distance. Models that incorporated rotation augmentation during self-supervised training exhibited significantly greater invariance to rotations. We hypothesise that the absence of rotational inductive bias in the transformer architecture necessitates rotation augmentation during training to achieve learned invariance.

| **[Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Clinical Pathology Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09521v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking foundation models as feature extractors for weakly-supervised computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15823v2)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in artificial intelligence have driven the development of numerous pathology foundation models capable of extracting clinically relevant information. However, there is currently limited literature independently evaluating these foundation models on truly external cohorts and clinically-relevant tasks to uncover adjustments for future improvements. In this study, we benchmarked 19 histopathology foundation models on 13 patient cohorts with 6,818 patients and 9,528 slides from lung, colorectal, gastric, and breast cancers. The models were evaluated on weakly-supervised tasks related to biomarkers, morphological properties, and prognostic outcomes. We show that a vision-language foundation model, CONCH, yielded the highest performance when compared to vision-only foundation models, with Virchow2 as close second. The experiments reveal that foundation models trained on distinct cohorts learn complementary features to predict the same label, and can be fused to outperform the current state of the art. An ensemble combining CONCH and Virchow2 predictions outperformed individual models in 55% of tasks, leveraging their complementary strengths in classification scenarios. Moreover, our findings suggest that data diversity outweighs data volume for foundation models. Our work highlights actionable adjustments to improve pathology foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Several Multiple Instance Learning frameworks proposed for this task utilize a ResNet50 backbone pre-trained on natural images. By leveraging recenetly released histopathological foundation models such as UNI and Hibou, the predictive prowess of existing MIL networks can be enhanced. Furthermore, deploying an ensemble of digital pathology foundation models yields higher baseline accuracy, although the benefits appear to diminish with more complex MIL architectures. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[PriorPath: Coarse-To-Fine Approach for Controlled De-Novo Pathology Semantic Masks Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16515v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into digital pathology offers promising prospects for automating and enhancing tasks such as image analysis and diagnostic processes. However, the diversity of tissue samples and the necessity for meticulous image labeling often result in biased datasets, constraining the applicability of algorithms trained on them. To harness synthetic histopathological images to cope with this challenge, it is essential not only to produce photorealistic images but also to be able to exert control over the cellular characteristics they depict. Previous studies used methods to generate, from random noise, semantic masks that captured the spatial distribution of the tissue. These masks were then used as a prior for conditional generative approaches to produce photorealistic histopathological images. However, as with many other generative models, this solution exhibits mode collapse as the model fails to capture the full diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we present a pipeline, coined PriorPath, that generates detailed, realistic, semantic masks derived from coarse-grained images delineating tissue regions. This approach enables control over the spatial arrangement of the generated masks and, consequently, the resulting synthetic images. We demonstrated the efficacy of our method across three cancer types, skin, prostate, and lung, showcasing PriorPath's capability to cover the semantic mask space and to provide better similarity to real masks compared to previous methods. Our approach allows for specifying desired tissue distributions and obtaining both photorealistic masks and images within a single platform, thus providing a state-of-the-art, controllable solution for generating histopathological images to facilitate AI for computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on visual-language models, which may impose limitations from a molecular perspective and lead to performance bottlenecks. Here, we introduce a Unified Molecule-enhanced Pathology Image REpresentationn Learning framework (UMPIRE). UMPIRE aims to leverage complementary information from gene expression profiles to guide the multimodal pre-training, enhancing the molecular awareness of pathology image representation learning. We demonstrate that this molecular perspective provides a robust, task-agnostic training signal for learning pathology image embeddings. Due to the scarcity of paired data, approximately 4 million entries of spatial transcriptomics gene expression were collected to train the gene encoder. By leveraging powerful pre-trained encoders, UMPIRE aligns the encoders across over 697K pathology image-gene expression pairs. The performance of UMPIRE is demonstrated across various molecular-related downstream tasks, including gene expression prediction, spot classification, and mutation state prediction in whole slide images. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and open new avenues for exploring computational pathology enhanced by molecular perspectives.

However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

However, most traditional deep learning and machine learning models need help to capture geometric features such as size and convexity of the segmentation targets, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To resolve this problem, we propose using a CovHuSeg algorithm to solve the problem of kidney glomeruli segmentation. This simple post-processing method is specified to adapt to the segmentation of ball-shaped anomalies, including the glomerulus. Unlike other post-processing methods, the CovHuSeg algorithm assures that the outcome mask does not have holes in it or comes in unusual shapes that are impossible to be the shape of a glomerulus. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by experimenting with multiple deep-learning models in the context of segmentation on kidney pathology images. The results show that all models have increased accuracy when using the CovHuSeg algorithm.</p></details> | Under review |

Despite the recent trend of adopting deep-learning approaches for analyzing complex pathology images, they fall short as they often overlook the domain-expert understanding of tissue structure and cell composition. In this work, we focus on a challenging Open-ended Pathology VQA (PathVQA-Open) task and propose a novel framework named Path-RAG, which leverages HistoCartography to retrieve relevant domain knowledge from pathology images and significantly improves performance on PathVQA-Open. Admitting the complexity of pathology image analysis, Path-RAG adopts a human-centered AI approach by retrieving domain knowledge using HistoCartography to select the relevant patches from pathology images. Our experiments suggest that domain guidance can significantly boost the accuracy of LLaVA-Med from 38% to 47%, with a notable gain of 28% for H&E-stained pathology images in the PathVQA-Open dataset. For longer-form question and answer pairs, our model consistently achieves significant improvements of 32.5% in ARCH-Open PubMed and 30.6% in ARCH-Open Books on H\&E images.

Despite their high computational demand, these models are extensively utilized for their superior sample quality and robust mode coverage. While research in diffusion generative models is advancing, exploration within the domain of computational pathology and its large-scale datasets has been comparatively gradual. Bridging the gap between the high-quality generation capabilities of Diffusion Generative Models and the intricate nature of pathology data, this paper presents an in-depth comparative analysis of diffusion methods applied to a pathology dataset. Our analysis extends to datasets with varying Fields of View (FOV), revealing that DGMs are highly effective in producing high-quality synthetic data. An ablative study is also conducted, followed by a detailed discussion on the impact of various methods on the synthesized histopathology images. One striking observation from our experiments is how the adjustment of image size during data generation can simulate varying fields of view. These findings underscore the potential of DGMs to enhance the quality and diversity of synthetic pathology data, especially when used with real data, ultimately increasing accuracy of deep learning models in histopathology.

Here, we develop a foundation model for prostate cancer digital pathology called HistoEncoder by pre-training on 48 million prostate tissue tile images. We demonstrate that HistoEncoder features extracted from tile images with similar histological patterns map closely together in the feature space. HistoEncoder outperforms models pre-trained with natural images, even without fine-tuning or with 1000 times less training data. We describe two use cases that leverage the capabilities of HistoEncoder by fine-tuning the model with a limited amount of data and computational resources. First, we show how HistoEncoder can be used to automatically annotate large-scale datasets with high accuracy. Second, we combine histomics with commonly used clinical nomograms, significantly improving prostate cancer-specific death survival models. Foundation models such as HistoEncoder can allow organizations with limited resources to build effective clinical software tools without needing extensive datasets or significant amounts of computing.</p></details> |  |

There is a need for AI models to analyze this data and assist clinical workflow. The lack of expert labelers and the large dataset required (>100,000 images) for model training and tuning are the main hurdles in creating foundation models. In this paper we introduce FoundationShift, a method to apply any AI model from computational pathology without retraining. We show our method is more accurate than state of the art models (SAM, MedSAM, SAM-Med2D, CellProfiler, Hover-Net, PLIP, UNI and ChatGPT), with multiple imaging modalities (OCT and RCM). This is achieved without the need for model retraining or fine-tuning. Applying our method to noninvasive in vivo images could enable physicians to readily incorporate optical imaging modalities into their clinical practice, providing real time tissue analysis and improving patient care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anatomy-Guided Radiology Report Generation with Pathology-Aware Regional Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10789v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate clinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high clinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle lesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely due to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and insufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the neglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial pathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate anatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly enhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop an anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical areas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global pathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists, producing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on most natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, with formal expert evaluations affirming its potential to enhance radiology practice.</p></details> |  |

This development enables comprehensive digital reviews by pathologists and accelerates AI-driven diagnostic support for WSI analysis. Recent advances in foundational pathology models have increased the need for benchmarking tasks. The Camelyon series is one of the most widely used open-source datasets in computational pathology. However, the quality, accessibility, and clinical relevance of the labels have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs and labels from the Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17 datasets, removing low-quality slides, correcting erroneous labels, and providing expert pixel annotations for tumor regions in the previously unreleased test set. Based on the sizes of re-annotated tumor regions, we upgraded the binary cancer screening task to a four-class task: negative, micro-metastasis, macro-metastasis, and Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC). We reevaluated pre-trained pathology feature extractors and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods using the cleaned dataset, providing a benchmark that advances AI development in histopathology.</p></details> |  |

Limited by the expensive cost of pixel-level annotation, current research primarily focuses on representation learning with slide-level labels, showing success in various downstream tasks. However, given the diversity of lesion types and the complex relationships between each other, these techniques still deserve further exploration in addressing advanced pathology tasks. To this end, we introduce the concept of hierarchical pathological image classification and propose a representation learning called PathTree. PathTree considers the multi-classification of diseases as a binary tree structure. Each category is represented as a professional pathological text description, which messages information with a tree-like encoder. The interactive text features are then used to guide the aggregation of hierarchical multiple representations. PathTree uses slide-text similarity to obtain probability scores and introduces two extra tree specific losses to further constrain the association between texts and slides. Through extensive experiments on three challenging hierarchical classification datasets: in-house cryosectioned lung tissue lesion identification, public prostate cancer grade assessment, and public breast cancer subtyping, our proposed PathTree is consistently competitive compared to the state-of-the-art methods and provides a new perspective on the deep learning-assisted solution for more complex WSI classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE. The source code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CATE.</p></details> |  |

We utilized an EEG dataset of 2,993 recordings from Temple University Hospital and a dataset of 55,787 recordings from Elmiko Biosignals sp. z o.o. The latter contains data from 39 hospitals and a diverse patient set with varied conditions. Thus, we introduce the Elmiko dataset - the largest publicly available EEG corpus. Our findings show that small and consistent datasets enable a wide range of models to achieve high accuracy; however, variations in pathological conditions, recording protocols, and labeling standards lead to significant performance degradation. Nonetheless, increasing the number of available recordings improves predictive accuracy and may even compensate for data diversity, particularly in neural networks based on attention mechanism or transformer architecture. A meta-model that combined these networks with a gradient-boosting approach using handcrafted features demonstrated superior performance across varied datasets.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |

A patient will have better prognosis when he has achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) with the treatment of NAC. There has been a trend to directly predict pCR to NAC from histological images based on deep learning (DL). However, the DL-based predictive models numerically have better performances in internal validation than in external validation. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this situation with an intrinsic approach. We propose an experts' cognition-driven ensemble deep learning (ECDEDL) approach. Taking the cognition of both pathology and artificial intelligence experts into consideration to improve the generalization of the predictive model to the external validation, ECDEDL can intrinsically approximate the working paradigm of a human being which will refer to his various working experiences to make decisions. ECDEDL was validated with 695 WSIs collected from the same center as the primary dataset to develop the predictive model and perform the internal validation, and was also validated with 340 WSIs collected from other three centers as the external dataset to perform the external validation. In external validation, ECDEDL improves the AUCs of pCR prediction from 61.52(59.80-63.26) to 67.75(66.74-68.80) and the Accuracies of pCR prediction from 56.09(49.39-62.79) to 71.01(69.44-72.58). ECDEDL was quite effective for external validation of predicting pCR to NAC from histological images in breast cancer, numerically approximating the internal validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the final published version</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Self-Supervised Barlow Twins from Limited Tissue Slide Cohorts for Colonic Pathology Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05959v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the few cancers that have an established dysplasia-carcinoma sequence that benefits from screening. Everyone over 50 years of age in Canada is eligible for CRC screening. About 20\% of those people will undergo a biopsy for a pre-neoplastic polyp and, in many cases, multiple polyps. As such, these polyp biopsies make up the bulk of a pathologist's workload. Developing an efficient computational model to help screen these polyp biopsies can improve the pathologist's workflow and help guide their attention to critical areas on the slide. DL models face significant challenges in computational pathology (CPath) because of the gigapixel image size of whole-slide images and the scarcity of detailed annotated datasets. It is, therefore, crucial to leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to alleviate the burden and cost of data annotation. However, current research lacks methods to apply SSL frameworks to analyze pathology data effectively. This paper aims to propose an optimized Barlow Twins framework for colorectal polyps screening. We adapt its hyperparameters, augmentation strategy and encoder to the specificity of the pathology data to enhance performance. Additionally, we investigate the best Field of View (FoV) for colorectal polyps screening and propose a new benchmark dataset for CRC screening, made of four types of colorectal polyps and normal tissue, by performing downstream tasking on MHIST and NCT-CRC-7K datasets. Furthermore, we show that the SSL representations are more meaningful and qualitative than the supervised ones and that Barlow Twins benefits from the Swin Transformer when applied to pathology data.

However, it remains an open question which factors are most important for downstream performance with data scale and diversity, model size, and training algorithm all playing a role. In this work, we propose algorithmic modifications, tailored for pathology, and we present the result of scaling both data and model size, surpassing previous studies in both dimensions. We introduce three new models: Virchow2, a 632 million parameter vision transformer, Virchow2G, a 1.9 billion parameter vision transformer, and Virchow2G Mini, a 22 million parameter distillation of Virchow2G, each trained with 3.1 million histopathology whole slide images, with diverse tissues, originating institutions, and stains. We achieve state of the art performance on 12 tile-level tasks, as compared to the top performing competing models. Our results suggest that data diversity and domain-specific methods can outperform models that only scale in the number of parameters, but, on average, performance benefits from the combination of domain-specific methods, data scale, and model scale.</p></details> |  |

However, previous pathological speech analysis models are commonly designed for a specific disease while overlooking the connection between diseases, which may constrain performance and lower training efficiency. Instead of fine-tuning deep models for different tasks, prompt tuning is a much more efficient training paradigm. We thus propose a unified pathological speech analysis system for as many as three diseases with the prompt tuning technique. This system uses prompt tuning to adjust only a small part of the parameters to detect different diseases from speeches of possible patients. Our system leverages a pre-trained spoken language model and demonstrates strong performance across multiple disorders while only fine-tuning a fraction of the parameters. This efficient training approach leads to faster convergence and improved F1 scores by allowing knowledge to be shared across tasks. Our experiments on Alzheimer's disease, Depression, and Parkinson's disease show competitive results, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in pathological speech analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, human-AI collaboration can introduce and amplify cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias caused by false confirmation when erroneous human opinions are reinforced by inaccurate AI output. This bias may worsen when time pressure, ubiquitously present in routine pathology, strains practitioners' cognitive resources. We quantified confirmation bias triggered by AI-induced false confirmation and examined the role of time constraints in a web-based experiment, where trained pathology experts (n=28) estimated tumor cell percentages. Our results suggest that AI integration may fuel confirmation bias, evidenced by a statistically significant positive linear-mixed-effects model coefficient linking AI recommendations mirroring flawed human judgment and alignment with system advice. Conversely, time pressure appeared to weaken this relationship. These findings highlight potential risks of AI use in healthcare and aim to support the safe integration of clinical decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

However, human-AI collaboration might introduce automation bias, where users uncritically follow automated cues. This bias may worsen when time pressure strains practitioners' cognitive resources. We quantified automation bias by measuring the adoption of negative system consultations and examined the role of time pressure in a web-based experiment, where trained pathology experts (n=28) estimated tumor cell percentages. Our results indicate that while AI integration led to a statistically significant increase in overall performance, it also resulted in a 7% automation bias rate, where initially correct evaluations were overturned by erroneous AI advice. Conversely, time pressure did not exacerbate automation bias occurrence, but appeared to increase its severity, evidenced by heightened reliance on the system's negative consultations and subsequent performance decline. These findings highlight potential risks of AI use in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

Immunohistochemistry aids in detecting specific biomarkers but is limited by its single-marker approach, restricting its ability to capture the full tissue environment. The advent of multiplexed imaging technologies, like multiplexed immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics, allows for simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers in a single section, enhancing morphological data with molecular and spatial information. This provides a more comprehensive view of the tissue microenvironment, cellular interactions, and disease mechanisms - crucial for understanding disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. However, the extensive data from multiplexed imaging necessitates sophisticated computational methods for preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and spatial analysis. These tools are vital for managing large, multidimensional datasets, converting raw imaging data into actionable insights. By automating labor-intensive tasks and enhancing reproducibility and accuracy, computational tools are pivotal in diagnostics and research. This review explores the current landscape of multiplexed imaging in pathology, detailing workflows and key technologies like PathML, an AI-powered platform that streamlines image analysis, making complex dataset interpretation accessible for clinical and research settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages (39 manuscript + 14 supplementary), 3 figures (figure 1, 2 and supplementary figure 1), 6 Tables (Table 1, 2, 3 and supplementary table 1,2,3)</p></details> |

Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Whole-Slide Pathology Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11761v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). We will fully release SlideChat, SlideInstruction and SlideBench as open-source resources to facilitate research and development in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, they continue to grapple with hallucination challenges and the generation of anatomically inaccurate outputs. These limitations are mainly due to the reliance on textual inputs and lack of spatial control over the generated images, hindering the potential usefulness of such models in real-life settings. In this work, we present XReal, a novel controllable diffusion model for generating realistic chest X-ray images through precise anatomy and pathology location control. Our lightweight method comprises an Anatomy Controller and a Pathology Controller to introduce spatial control over anatomy and pathology in a pre-trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Model, respectively, without fine-tuning the model. XReal outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray diffusion models in quantitative metrics and radiologists' ratings, showing significant gains in anatomy and pathology realism. Our model holds promise for advancing generative models in medical imaging, offering greater precision and adaptability while inviting further exploration in this evolving field.

Amongst approaches to improve model interpretability, concept-based explanations aim to provide concise and human-understandable explanations of any arbitrary classifier. However, such methods usually require a large amount of manually collected data with concept annotation, which is often scarce in the medical domain. In this paper, we propose Conceptual Counterfactual Explanations for Chest X-ray (CoCoX), which leverages the joint embedding space of an existing vision-language model (VLM) to explain black-box classifier outcomes without the need for annotated datasets. Specifically, we utilize textual concepts derived from chest radiography reports and a pre-trained chest radiography-based VLM to explain three common cardiothoracic pathologies. We demonstrate that the explanations generated by our method are semantically meaningful and faithful to underlying pathologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS'24 workshop on Advancements In Medical Foundation Models: Explainability, Robustness, Security, and Beyond (AIM-FM)</p></details> |

However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark four pathology-specific foundation models across 14 datasets and two scenarios-consistency assessment and flexibility assessment-addressing diverse adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the same downstream task. In the flexibility assessment scenario under data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of pathology image analysis.

However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework.

Current methods fail to retain prosody and unique speech patterns found in elderly and pathological speech domains, which is essential for remote health monitoring. To address this gap, we propose a voice conversion-based method (DDSP-QbE) using differentiable digital signal processing and query-by-example. The proposed method, trained with novel losses, aids in disentangling linguistic, prosodic, and domain representations, enabling the model to adapt to uncommon speech patterns. Objective and subjective evaluations show that DDSP-QbE significantly outperforms the voice conversion state-of-the-art concerning intelligibility, prosody, and domain preservation across diverse datasets, pathologies, and speakers while maintaining quality and speaker anonymity.

However, the availability of high-quality datasets for deep learning methods is often limited due to the complexity of the annotation process. In this work, we investigate the impact of noisy annotations on the training and performance of a state-of-the-art CNN model for the combined task of detecting, segmenting and classifying nuclei in histopathology images. In this context, we investigate the conditions for determining an appropriate number of training epochs to prevent overfitting to annotation noise during training. Our results indicate that the utilisation of a small, correctly annotated validation set is instrumental in avoiding overfitting and maintaining model performance to a large extent. Additionally, our findings underscore the beneficial role of pre-training.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts have utilized pre-trained contrastive image-text models like CLIP, adapting them for medical use by fine-tuning the model with chest X-ray images and corresponding reports for zero-shot pathology classification, thus eliminating the need for pathology-specific annotations. However, most studies continue to use the same contrastive learning objectives as in the general domain, overlooking the multi-labeled nature of medical image-report pairs. In this paper, we propose a new fine-tuning strategy that includes positive-pair loss relaxation and random sentence sampling. We aim to improve the performance of zero-shot pathology classification without relying on external knowledge. Our method can be applied to any pre-trained contrastive image-text encoder and easily transferred to out-of-domain datasets without further training, as it does not use external data. Our approach consistently improves overall zero-shot pathology classification across four chest X-ray datasets and three pre-trained models, with an average macro AUROC increase of 4.3%. Additionally, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art and marginally surpasses board-certified radiologists in zero-shot classification for the five competition pathologies in the CheXpert dataset.</p></details> |  |

They are intended to be general-purpose feature extractors, promising to achieve good performance on a range of downstream tasks. Real-world pathology image data does however exhibit considerable variability. Foundation models should be robust to these variations and other distribution shifts which might be encountered in practice. We evaluate two computational pathology foundation models: UNI (trained on more than 100,000 whole-slide images) and CONCH (trained on more than 1.1 million image-caption pairs), by utilizing them as feature extractors within prostate cancer grading models. We find that while UNI and CONCH perform well relative to baselines, the absolute performance can still be far from satisfactory in certain settings. The fact that foundation models have been trained on large and varied datasets does not guarantee that downstream models always will be robust to common distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

Integrating biophysics-informed regularisation is one effective way to change this situation, as it provides an prior regularisation for automated end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that designs brain tumour growth Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models as a regularisation with deep learning, operational with any network model. Our method introduces tumour growth PDE models directly into the segmentation process, improving accuracy and robustness, especially in data-scarce scenarios. This system estimates tumour cell density using a periodic activation function. By effectively integrating this estimation with biophysical models, we achieve better capture of tumour characteristics. This approach not only aligns the segmentation closer to actual biological behaviour but also strengthens the model's performance under limited data conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on the BraTS 2023 dataset, showcasing significant improvements in both precision and reliability of tumour segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures and 1 table.

Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is built from statistical theory in line with evidence-based medicine. The two core technologies are the classification information of image features, which was introduced based on information theory and which cancer features take positive values, normal features take negative values, and the calculation technique for determining their spatial distribution. This method then estimates areas where the classification information content shows a positive value as cancer areas in the pathological image. The method achieves AUCs of 0.95 or higher in cancer classification tasks. In addition, the proposed method has the practical advantage of not requiring a precise demarcation line between cancer and normal. This frees pathologists from the monotonous and tedious work of building consensus with other pathologists.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Recent studies concentrate on handling the consistency between visual and textual pathological features to improve the coherence of report. However, there exist some challenges: 1) Redundant visual representing: Massive irrelevant areas in 3D scans distract models from representing salient visual contexts. 2) Shifted semantic representing: Limited medical corpus causes difficulties for models to transfer the learned textual representations to generative layers. This study introduces a Pathological Clue-driven Representation Learning (PCRL) model to build cross-modal representations based on pathological clues and naturally adapt them for accurate report generation. Specifically, we construct pathological clues from perspectives of segmented regions, pathological entities, and report themes, to fully grasp visual pathological patterns and learn cross-modal feature representations. To adapt the representations for the text generation task, we bridge the gap between representation learning and report generation by using a unified large language model (LLM) with task-tailored instructions. These crafted instructions enable the LLM to be flexibly fine-tuned across tasks and smoothly transfer the semantic representation for report generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods and achieves SoTA performance.

This study aimed to explore whether the presence and location of lobar microbleeds are associated with amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-PET, tau tangle formation (tau-PET), and longitudinal cognitive decline. We analyzed 1,573 ADNI participants with MR imaging data and information on the number and location of microbleeds. Associations between lobar microbleeds and pathology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetics, and cognition were examined, focusing on regional microbleeds and domain-specific cognitive decline using ordinary least-squares regression while adjusting for covariates. Cognitive decline was assessed with ADAS-Cog11 and its domain-specific sub-scores. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing at least twice, with a minimum two-year interval between assessments. Among the 1,573 participants (692 women, mean age 71.23 years), 373 participants had microbleeds. The presence of microbleeds was linked to cognitive decline, particularly in the semantic, language, and praxis domains for those with temporal lobe microbleeds. Microbleeds in the overall cortex were associated with language decline. Pathologically, temporal lobe microbleeds were associated with increased tau in the overall cortex, while cortical microbleeds were linked to elevated A$\beta$ in the temporal, parietal, and frontal regions. In this mixed population, microbleeds were connected to longitudinal cognitive decline, especially in semantic and language domains, and were associated with higher baseline A$\beta$ and tau pathology. These findings suggest that lobar microbleeds should be included in AD diagnostic and prognostic evaluations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Beyond Derivative Pathology of PINNs: Variable Splitting Strategy with Convergence Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20383v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as effective methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in various problems. Substantial research focuses on the failure modes of PINNs due to their frequent inaccuracies in predictions. However, most are based on the premise that minimizing the loss function to zero causes the network to converge to a solution of the governing PDE. In this study, we prove that PINNs encounter a fundamental issue that the premise is invalid. We also reveal that this issue stems from the inability to regulate the behavior of the derivatives of the predicted solution. Inspired by the \textit{derivative pathology} of PINNs, we propose a \textit{variable splitting} strategy that addresses this issue by parameterizing the gradient of the solution as an auxiliary variable. We demonstrate that using the auxiliary variable eludes derivative pathology by enabling direct monitoring and regulation of the gradient of the predicted solution. Moreover, we prove that the proposed method guarantees convergence to a generalized solution for second-order linear PDEs, indicating its applicability to various problems.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this requires domain generalization (DG) algorithms. However, a systematic evaluation of DG algorithms in the CPath context is lacking. This study aims to benchmark the effectiveness of 30 DG algorithms on 3 CPath tasks of varying difficulty through 7,560 cross-validation runs. We evaluate these algorithms using a unified and robust platform, incorporating modality-specific techniques and recent advances like pretrained foundation models. Our extensive cross-validation experiments provide insights into the relative performance of various DG strategies. We observe that self-supervised learning and stain augmentation consistently outperform other methods, highlighting the potential of pretrained models and data augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a new pan-cancer tumor detection dataset (HISTOPANTUM) as a benchmark for future research. This study offers valuable guidance to researchers in selecting appropriate DG approaches for CPath tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |

Current prognostic tools like Oncotype DX (ODX) offer valuable genomic insights for HR+/HER2- patients but are limited by cost and accessibility, particularly in underserved populations. In this study, we present Deep-BCR-Auto, a deep learning-based computational pathology approach that predicts breast cancer recurrence risk from routine H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Our methodology was validated on two independent cohorts: the TCGA-BRCA dataset and an in-house dataset from The Ohio State University (OSU). Deep-BCR-Auto demonstrated robust performance in stratifying patients into low- and high-recurrence risk categories. On the TCGA-BRCA dataset, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.827, significantly outperforming existing weakly supervised models (p=0.041). In the independent OSU dataset, Deep-BCR-Auto maintained strong generalizability, achieving an AUROC of 0.832, along with 82.0% accuracy, 85.0% specificity, and 67.7% sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of computational pathology as a cost-effective alternative for recurrence risk assessment, broadening access to personalized treatment strategies. This study underscores the clinical utility of integrating deep learning-based computational pathology into routine pathological assessment for breast cancer prognosis across diverse clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have recently sought to leverage advances in machine learning algorithms to detect symptoms of altered gait, possibly corresponding to the emergence of neurodegenerative etiologies. However, while several claims of positive and accurate detection have been made in the recent literature, using a variety of sensors and algorithms, solutions are far from being realized in practice. This paper analyzes existing approaches to identify gaps inhibiting translation. Using a set of experiments across three Kinect-simulated and one real Parkinson's patient datasets, we highlight possible sources of errors and generalization failures in these approaches. Based on these observations, we propose our strong baseline called Asynchronous Multi-Stream Graph Convolutional Network (AMS-GCN) that can reliably differentiate multiple categories of pathological gaits across datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, Accepted in Machine Learning for Healthcare(MLHC) 2024, JMLR Volume 252</p></details> |

In response, speaker anonymization aims to conceal personally identifiable information while retaining crucial linguistic content. However, the application of anonymization techniques to pathological speech, a critical area where privacy is especially vital, has not been extensively examined. This study investigates anonymization's impact on pathological speech across over 2,700 speakers from multiple German institutions, focusing on privacy, pathological utility, and demographic fairness. We explore both deep-learning-based and signal processing-based anonymization methods. We document substantial privacy improvements across disorders-evidenced by equal error rate increases up to 1933%, with minimal overall impact on utility. Specific disorders such as Dysarthria, Dysphonia, and Cleft Lip and Palate experience minimal utility changes, while Dysglossia shows slight improvements. Our findings underscore that the impact of anonymization varies substantially across different disorders. This necessitates disorder-specific anonymization strategies to optimally balance privacy with diagnostic utility. Additionally, our fairness analysis reveals consistent anonymization effects across most of the demographics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of anonymization in pathological speech for enhancing privacy, while also highlighting the importance of customized and disorder-specific approaches to account for inversion attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Communications Medicine</p></details> |

These representations may contain pathology irrelevant uncorrelated information, such as changing phonetic content or variations in speaking style across time, which can adversely affect classification performance. To address this issue, we propose to use Multiview Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA) on these input representations prior to automatic pathological speech detection. Our results demonstrate that unlike other dimensionality reduction techniques, the use of MCCA leads to a considerable improvement in pathological speech detection performance by eliminating uncorrelated information present in the input representations. Employing MCCA with traditional classifiers yields a comparable or higher performance than using sophisticated architectures, while preserving the representation structure and providing interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

However, the robustness of these models is often severely compromised in the presence of data shifts (e.g., different stains, organs, centers, etc.). Alternatively, continual learning (CL) techniques aim to reduce the forgetting of past data when learning new data with distributional shift conditions. Specifically, rehearsal-based CL techniques, which store some past data in a buffer and then replay it with new data, have proven effective in medical image analysis tasks. However, privacy concerns arise as these approaches store past data, prompting the development of our novel Generative Latent Replay-based CL (GLRCL) approach. GLRCL captures the previous distribution through Gaussian Mixture Models instead of storing past samples, which are then utilized to generate features and perform latent replay with new data. We systematically evaluate our proposed framework under different shift conditions in histopathology data, including stain and organ shift. Our approach significantly outperforms popular buffer-free CL approaches and performs similarly to rehearsal-based CL approaches that require large buffers causing serious privacy violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

F-SEG allows the use of pre-trained deep neural networks, including recently developed pathology foundation models, for semantic segmentation. It achieves this without requiring additional training or finetuning, by factorizing the spatial features extracted by the models into segmentation masks and their associated concept features. We create generic tissue phenotypes for H&E images by training clustering models for multiple numbers of clusters on features extracted from several deep learning models on The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), and then show how the clusters can be used for factorizing corresponding segmentation masks using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Our results show that F-SEG provides robust unsupervised segmentation capabilities for H&E pathology images, and that the segmentation quality is greatly improved by utilizing pathology foundation models. We discuss and propose methods for evaluating the performance of unsupervised segmentation in pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Short Survey on Set-Based Aggregation Techniques for Single-Vector WSI Representation in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04615v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by enabling the digitization, storage, and analysis of tissue samples as whole slide images (WSIs). WSIs are gigapixel files that capture the intricate details of tissue samples, providing a rich source of information for diagnostic and research purposes. However, due to their enormous size, representing these images as one compact vector is essential for many computational pathology tasks, such as search and retrieval, to ensure efficiency and scalability. Most current methods are "patch-oriented," meaning they divide WSIs into smaller patches for processing, which prevents a holistic analysis of the entire slide. Additionally, the necessity for compact representation is driven by the expensive high-performance storage required for WSIs. Not all hospitals have access to such extensive storage solutions, leading to potential disparities in healthcare quality and accessibility. This paper provides an overview of existing set-based approaches to single-vector WSI representation, highlighting the innovations that allow for more efficient and effective use of these complex images in digital pathology, thus addressing both computational challenges and storage limitations.</p></details> |  |

With the proposal of Segment Anything Model (SAM), more and more foundation models have seen rapid development in the field of image segmentation. Recently, SAM2 has garnered widespread attention in both natural image and medical image segmentation. Compared to SAM, it has significantly improved in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization performance. We compared the foundational models based on SAM and found that their performance in semantic segmentation of pathological images was hardly satisfactory. In this paper, we propose Path-SAM2, which for the first time adapts the SAM2 model to cater to the task of pathological semantic segmentation. We integrate the largest pretrained vision encoder for histopathology (UNI) with the original SAM2 encoder, adding more pathology-based prior knowledge. Additionally, we introduce a learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) classification module to replace the manual prompt process. In three adenoma pathological datasets, Path-SAM2 has achieved state-of-the-art performance.This study demonstrates the great potential of adapting SAM2 to pathology image segmentation tasks.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly multimodal models like ChatGPT, have shown promise in transforming medical image analysis through capabilities such as medical vision-language question answering. However, there remains a significant gap in integrating pathology image data with these AI models for clinical applications. This study benchmarks the performance of GPT on pathology images, assessing their diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in real-word clinical records. We observe significant deficits of GPT in bone diseases and a fair-level performance in diseases from other three systems. Despite offering satisfactory abnormality annotations, GPT exhibits consistent disadvantage in terminology accuracy and multimodal integration. Specifically, we demonstrate GPT's failures in interpreting immunohistochemistry results and diagnosing metastatic cancers. This study highlight the weakness of current generalist GPT model and contribute to the integration of pathology and advanced AI.</p></details> |  |

Recently it has been shown that databases commonly used to develop and evaluate such approaches are noisy, with the noise characteristics between healthy and pathological recordings being different. Consequently, automatic approaches trained on these databases often learn to discriminate noise rather than speech pathology. This paper introduces a method to mitigate this noise disparity in training data. Using noise estimates from recordings from one group of speakers to augment recordings from the other group, the noise characteristics become consistent across all recordings. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in mitigating noise disparity in training data, thereby enabling automatic pathological speech detection to focus on pathology-discriminant cues rather than noise-discriminant ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IWAENC 2024</p></details> |

Specifically for gastric cancer (GC), chronic inflammation causes changes in the mucosa such as atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia and ultimately cancer. Early detection through endoscopic regular surveillance is essential for better outcomes. Foundation models (FM), which are machine or deep learning models trained on diverse data and applicable to broad use cases, offer a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of endoscopy and its subsequent pathology image analysis. This review explores the recent advancements, applications, and challenges associated with FM in endoscopy and pathology imaging. We started by elucidating the core principles and architectures underlying these models, including their training methodologies and the pivotal role of large-scale data in developing their predictive capabilities. Moreover, this work discusses emerging trends and future research directions, emphasizing the integration of multimodal data, the development of more robust and equitable models, and the potential for real-time diagnostic support. This review aims to provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners in navigating the complexities of incorporating FM into clinical practice for prevention/management of GC cases, thereby improving patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

While biases in machine learning models are often assumed to be due to biases in training data, we find pathological internal color and luminance biases in the discriminator of a pre-trained StyleGAN3-r model that are not explicable by the training data. We also find that the discriminator systematically stratifies scores by both image- and face-level qualities and that this disproportionately affects images across gender, race, and other categories. We examine axes common in research on stereotyping in social psychology.</p></details> |  |

High-resolution WSIs are essential for precise diagnosis but technical limitations in scanning equipment and variablity in slide preparation can hinder obtaining these images. Super-resolution techniques can enhance low-resolution images; while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been effective in natural image super-resolution tasks, they often struggle with histopathology due to overfitting and mode collapse. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short in assessing the complex characteristics of histopathology images, necessitating robust histology-specific evaluation methods. We introduce Histo-Diffusion, a novel diffusion-based method specially designed for generating and evaluating super-resolution images in digital pathology. It includes a restoration module for histopathology prior and a controllable diffusion module for generating high-quality images. We have curated two histopathology datasets and proposed a comprehensive evaluation strategy which incorporates both full-reference and no-reference metrics to thoroughly assess the quality of digital pathology images. Comparative analyses on multiple datasets with state-of-the-art methods reveal that Histo-Diffusion outperforms GANs. Our method offers a versatile solution for histopathology image super-resolution, capable of handling multi-resolution generation from varied input sizes, providing valuable support in diagnostic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have submitted our paper to Medical Image Analysis and are currently awaiting feedback</p></details> |

Despite the progress made, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a promising paradigm within CPath, continues to face challenges, particularly related to incomplete information utilization. Existing frameworks, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), attention, and selective scan space state sequential model (SSM), lack sufficient flexibility and scalability in fusing diverse features, and cannot effectively fuse diverse features. Additionally, current approaches do not adequately exploit order-related and order-independent features, resulting in suboptimal utilization of sequence information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MIL framework called Mamba2MIL. Our framework utilizes the state space duality model (SSD) to model long sequences of patches of whole slide images (WSIs), which, combined with weighted feature selection, supports the fusion processing of more branching features and can be extended according to specific application needs. Moreover, we introduce a sequence transformation method tailored to varying WSI sizes, which enhances sequence-independent features while preserving local sequence information, thereby improving sequence information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mamba2MIL surpasses state-of-the-art MIL methods. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets, achieving improvements in nearly all performance metrics. Specifically, on the NSCLC dataset, Mamba2MIL achieves a binary tumor classification AUC of 0.9533 and an accuracy of 0.8794. On the BRACS dataset, it achieves a multiclass classification AUC of 0.7986 and an accuracy of 0.4981. The code is available at https://github.com/YuqiZhang-Buaa/Mamba2MIL.</p></details> |  |

While X-ray imaging remains a prevalent diagnostic tool, the increasing misinterpretation rates highlight the need for more accurate analysis, especially considering the lack of specialized training among many surgeons and physicians. Recent advancements in deep convolutional neural networks offer promise in automating pathology detection in trauma X-rays. However, distinguishing subtle variations between {pediatric} wrist pathologies in X-rays remains challenging. Traditional manual annotation, though effective, is laborious, costly, and requires specialized expertise. {In this paper, we address the challenge of pediatric wrist pathology recognition with a fine-grained approach, aimed at automatically identifying discriminative regions in X-rays without manual intervention. We refine our fine-grained architecture through ablation analysis and the integration of LION.} Leveraging Grad-CAM, an explainable AI technique, we highlight these regions. Despite using limited data, reflective of real-world medical study constraints, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image recognition models on both augmented and original (challenging) test sets. {Our proposed refined architecture achieves an increase in accuracy of 1.06% and 1.25% compared to the baseline method, resulting in accuracies of 86% and 84%, respectively. Moreover, our approach demonstrates the highest fracture sensitivity of 97%, highlighting its potential to enhance wrist pathology recognition.

While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce EXAONEPath, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. EXAONEPath is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs. Our experiments demonstrate that EXAONEPath significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared EXAONEPath with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that EXAONEPath achieves superior performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | License updated |

Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data.

Recent studies has demonstrated that the large vision-language model can enhance the performance of various downstream tasks in medical image understanding. In this study, we developed a domain-specific large language-vision assistant (PA-LLaVA) for pathology image understanding. Specifically, (1) we first construct a human pathology image-text dataset by cleaning the public medical image-text data for domain-specific alignment; (2) Using the proposed image-text data, we first train a pathology language-image pretraining (PLIP) model as the specialized visual encoder for pathology image, and then we developed scale-invariant connector to avoid the information loss caused by image scaling; (3) We adopt two-stage learning to train PA-LLaVA, first stage for domain alignment, and second stage for end to end visual question \& answering (VQA) task.

Training high-quality deep-learning models for layer segmentation relies on the availability of large amounts of annotated data. However, due to the patient's privacy of medical data and scarce clinical cases, constructing pathological datasets from clinical sources is relatively difficult and expensive. Moreover, using external natural image datasets introduces noise during the domain generalization process. Cross-species homologous data, such as mouse kidney data, which exhibits high structural and feature similarity to human kidneys, has the potential to enhance model performance on human datasets. In this study, we incorporated the collected private Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stained mouse kidney dataset into the human kidney dataset for joint training. The results showed that after introducing cross-species homologous data, the semantic segmentation models based on CNN and Transformer architectures achieved an average increase of 1.77% and 1.24% in mIoU, and 1.76% and 0.89% in Dice score for the human renal cortex and medulla datasets, respectively. This approach is also capable of enhancing the model's generalization ability. This indicates that cross-species homologous data, as a low-noise trainable data source, can help improve model performance under conditions of limited clinical samples.

Its integration into safe clinical decision-making support requires robust and reliable models. However, real-world data comes with diversities that often lie outside the intended source distribution. Moreover, when test samples are dramatically different, clinical decision-making is greatly affected. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in models is crucial for well-calibrated predictions and determining when (or not) to trust a model. Unfortunately, many works have overlooked the importance of predictive uncertainty estimation. This paper evaluates whether predictive uncertainty estimation adds robustness to deep learning-based diagnostic decision-making systems. We investigate the effect of various carcinoma distribution shift scenarios on predictive performance and calibration. We first systematically investigate three popular methods for improving predictive uncertainty: Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensemble, and few-shot learning on lung adenocarcinoma classification as a primary disease in whole slide images. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness of the methods in terms of performance and calibration under clinically relevant distribution shifts such as in-distribution shifts comprising primary disease sub-types and other characterization analysis data; out-of-distribution shifts comprising well-differentiated cases, different organ origin, and imaging modality shifts. While studies on uncertainty estimation exist, to our best knowledge, no rigorous large-scale benchmark compares predictive uncertainty estimation including these dataset shifts for lung carcinoma classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The advent of Whole Slide Scanners and the development of deep learning technologies have significantly advanced the field, leading to extensive research and development in pathology AI (Artificial Intelligence). These advancements have contributed to reducing the workload of pathologists and supporting decision-making in treatment plans. Recently, large-scale AI models known as Foundation Models (FMs), which are more accurate and applicable to a wide range of tasks compared to traditional AI, have emerged, and expanded their application scope in the healthcare field. Numerous FMs have been developed in pathology, and there are reported cases of their application in various tasks, such as disease diagnosis, rare cancer diagnosis, patient survival prognosis prediction, biomarker expression prediction, and the scoring of immunohistochemical expression intensity. However, several challenges remain for the clinical application of FMs, which healthcare professionals, as users, must be aware of. Research is ongoing to address these challenges. In the future, it is expected that the development of Generalist Medical AI, which integrates pathology FMs with FMs from other medical domains, will progress, leading to the effective utilization of AI in real clinical settings to promote precision and personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multistain Pretraining for Slide Representation Learning in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02859v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing self-supervised learning (SSL) models that can learn universal and transferable representations of H&E gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is becoming increasingly valuable in computational pathology. These models hold the potential to advance critical tasks such as few-shot classification, slide retrieval, and patient stratification. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from small images (e.g., 224 x 224 patches) to entire slides, usually by aligning two different augmentations (or views) of the slide. Yet the resulting representation remains constrained by the limited clinical and biological diversity of the views. Instead, we postulate that slides stained with multiple markers, such as immunohistochemistry, can be used as different views to form a rich task-agnostic training signal. To this end, we introduce Madeleine, a multimodal pretraining strategy for slide representation learning. Madeleine is trained with a dual global-local cross-stain alignment objective on large cohorts of breast cancer samples (N=4,211 WSIs across five stains) and kidney transplant samples (N=12,070 WSIs across four stains). We demonstrate the quality of slide representations learned by Madeleine on various downstream evaluations, ranging from morphological and molecular classification to prognostic prediction, comprising 21 tasks using 7,299 WSIs from multiple medical centers.

| **[PathoDuet: Foundation Models for Pathological Slide Analysis of H&E and IHC Stains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09894v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large amounts of digitized histopathological data display a promising future for developing pathological foundation models via self-supervised learning methods. Foundation models pretrained with these methods serve as a good basis for downstream tasks. However, the gap between natural and histopathological images hinders the direct application of existing methods. In this work, we present PathoDuet, a series of pretrained models on histopathological images, and a new self-supervised learning framework in histopathology. The framework is featured by a newly-introduced pretext token and later task raisers to explicitly utilize certain relations between images, like multiple magnifications and multiple stains. Based on this, two pretext tasks, cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring, are designed to pretrain the model on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images and transfer the model to immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, respectively. To validate the efficacy of our models, we evaluate the performance over a wide variety of downstream tasks, including patch-level colorectal cancer subtyping and whole slide image (WSI)-level classification in H&E field, together with expression level prediction of IHC marker, tumor identification and slide-level qualitative analysis in IHC field. The experimental results show the superiority of our models over most tasks and the efficacy of proposed pretext tasks. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/openmedlab/PathoDuet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 39 specific tasks. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM) is pretrained on a large-scale dataset consisting of 190 million images from around 86,000 public H&E whole slides across 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.36, with 29 tasks ranked 1st, while the the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 2.96, with only 4 tasks ranked 1st. The superior generalization of GPFM demonstrates its exceptional modeling capabilities across a wide range of clinical tasks, positioning it as a new cornerstone for feature representation in CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Validation of Search & Retrieval of Tissue Images in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01570v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical images play a crucial role in modern healthcare by providing vital information for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Fields such as radiology and pathology rely heavily on accurate image interpretation, with radiologists examining X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to diagnose conditions from fractures to cancer, while pathologists use microscopy and digital images to detect cellular abnormalities for diagnosing cancers and infections. The technological advancements have exponentially increased the volume and complexity of medical images, necessitating efficient tools for management and retrieval. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems address this need by searching and retrieving images based on visual content, enhancing diagnostic accuracy by allowing clinicians to find similar cases and compare pathological patterns. Comprehensive validation of image search engines in medical applications involves evaluating performance metrics like accuracy, indexing, and search times, and storage overhead, ensuring reliable and efficient retrieval of accurate results, as demonstrated by recent validations in histopathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Importance of Downstream Networks in Digital Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a static downstream aggregation model setup, encompassing a fixed architecture and hyperparameters, a practice we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a sensitivity of feature extractor models towards aggregation model configurations, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen configurations. By accounting for this sensitivity, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the feature extractors' sensitivity to various aggregation model configurations, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of new foundation models in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

The majority of applications have been justified through the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. In this paper, we take a step further and investigate how well dot product and cosine similarity are preserved by random projections when these are applied over the rows of the graph matrix. Our analysis provides new asymptotic and finite-sample results, identifies pathological cases, and tests them with numerical experiments. We specialize our fundamental results to a ranking application by computing the probability of random projections flipping the node ordering induced by their embeddings. We find that, depending on the degree distribution, the method produces especially unreliable embeddings for the dot product, regardless of whether the adjacency or the normalized transition matrix is used. With respect to the statistical noise introduced by random projections, we show that cosine similarity produces remarkably more precise approximations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathological Semantics-Preserving Learning for H&E-to-IHC Virtual Staining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03655v2)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining is limited to revealing cell morphology and distribution, whereas immunohistochemical (IHC) staining provides precise and specific visualization of protein activation at the molecular level. Virtual staining technology has emerged as a solution for highly efficient IHC examination, which directly transforms H&E-stained images to IHC-stained images. However, virtual staining is challenged by the insufficient mining of pathological semantics and the spatial misalignment of pathological semantics. To address these issues, we propose the Pathological Semantics-Preserving Learning method for Virtual Staining (PSPStain), which directly incorporates the molecular-level semantic information and enhances semantics interaction despite any spatial inconsistency. Specifically, PSPStain comprises two novel learning strategies: 1) Protein-Aware Learning Strategy (PALS) with Focal Optical Density (FOD) map maintains the coherence of protein expression level, which represents molecular-level semantic information; 2) Prototype-Consistent Learning Strategy (PCLS), which enhances cross-image semantic interaction by prototypical consistency learning. We evaluate PSPStain on two public datasets using five metrics: three clinically relevant metrics and two for image quality. Extensive experiments indicate that PSPStain outperforms current state-of-the-art H&E-to-IHC virtual staining methods and demonstrates a high pathological correlation between the staging of real and virtual stains.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by MICCAI2024</p></details> |

Moreover, these models exhibit a bias for contrast-based images, with diminished performance on texture-based medical images. This study introduces the notion of a population-level context for pathology detection and employs a graph theoretic approach to model and incorporate it into the latent code of an autoencoder via a refinement module we term PopuSense. PopuSense seeks to capture additional intra-group variations inherent in biomedical data that a local or global context of the convolutional model might miss or smooth out. Proof-of-concept experiments on contrast-based and texture-based images, with minimal adaptation, encounter the existing preference for intensity-based input. Nevertheless, PopuSense demonstrates improved separability in contrast-based images, presenting an additional avenue for refining representations learned by a model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17734v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Re-Embedding: Towards Foundation Model-Level Performance in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17228v4)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the most widely used framework in computational pathology, encompassing sub-typing, diagnosis, prognosis, and more. However, the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor, such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks, limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue, we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) for re-embedding the instance features online, which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator, R$^2$T is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features, and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the R$^2$T can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) R$^2$T-MIL, as an R$^2$T-enhanced AB-MIL, outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/RRT-MIL.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

The field, however, grapples with issues such as outcome variability, laborious processes, and a scarcity of trained professionals. This paper presents SongCi, an innovative visual-language model (VLM) designed specifically for forensic pathology. SongCi utilizes advanced prototypical cross-modal self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability of forensic analyses. It was pre-trained and evaluated on a comprehensive multi-center dataset, which includes over 16 million high-resolution image patches, 2,228 vision-language pairs of post-mortem whole slide images (WSIs), and corresponding gross key findings, along with 471 distinct diagnostic outcomes. Our findings indicate that SongCi surpasses existing multi-modal AI models in many forensic pathology tasks, performs comparably to experienced forensic pathologists and significantly better than less experienced ones, and provides detailed multi-modal explainability, offering critical assistance in forensic investigations. To the best of our knowledge, SongCi is the first VLM specifically developed for forensic pathological analysis and the first large-vocabulary computational pathology (CPath) model that directly processes gigapixel WSIs in forensic science.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 6 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, the potential of these advanced methods is limited by the lack of available labeled data. Although image synthesis via recent generative models has been actively explored to address this challenge, existing works have barely addressed label augmentation and are mostly limited to single-class and unconditional label generation. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage framework for multi-class nuclei data augmentation using text-conditional diffusion models. In the first stage, we innovate nuclei label synthesis by generating multi-class semantic labels and corresponding instance maps through a joint diffusion model conditioned by text prompts that specify the label structure information. In the second stage, we utilize a semantic and text-conditional latent diffusion model to efficiently generate high-quality pathology images that align with the generated nuclei label images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on large and diverse pathology nuclei datasets, with evaluations including qualitative and quantitative analyses, as well as assessments of downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 accepted |

However, existing deep learning models heavily rely on expert annotations and lack generalization capabilities in open clinical environments. In this study, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc lies in its extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts from reports with abundant image features, to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies and unseen pathologies without the reliance on image annotations from experts. We demonstrate the proof of concept on Chest X-ray images, with extensive experimental validation across 6 distinct external datasets, encompassing 13 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pathology localization and classification, and even outperforms the human benchmark in locating 5 different pathologies. Additionally, we further verify its generalization ability by applying it to retinal fundus images. Our approach showcases AFLoc's versatilities and underscores its suitability for clinical diagnosis in complex clinical environments.</p></details> |  |

In clinical settings, restricted access to pathology slides is inevitable due to patient privacy concerns and the prevalence of rare or emerging diseases. The emergence of the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification accommodates the significant challenge of the limited slide data and sparse slide-level labels for diagnosis. Prompt learning based on the pre-trained models (\eg, CLIP) appears to be a promising scheme for this setting; however, current research in this area is limited, and existing algorithms often focus solely on patch-level prompts or confine themselves to language prompts. This paper proposes a multi-instance prompt learning framework enhanced with pathology knowledge, \ie, integrating visual and textual prior knowledge into prompts at both patch and slide levels. The training process employs a combination of static and learnable prompts, effectively guiding the activation of pre-trained models and further facilitating the diagnosis of key pathology patterns. Lightweight Messenger (self-attention) and Summary (attention-pooling) layers are introduced to model relationships between patches and slides within the same patient data. Additionally, alignment-wise contrastive losses ensure the feature-level alignment between visual and textual learnable prompts for both patches and slides. Our method demonstrates superior performance in three challenging clinical tasks, significantly outperforming comparative few-shot methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Despite the predominant focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models with simple linear probing. The code is available at https://github.com/openmedlab/PathoDuet.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 |

Its zero-shot learning capabilities accelerate AI deployment and enhance the generalizability of clinical applications. However, segmenting pathological images presents a special focus on the flexibility of segmentation targets. For instance, a single click on a Whole Slide Image (WSI) could signify a cell, a functional unit, or layers, adding layers of complexity to the segmentation tasks. Current models primarily predict potential outcomes but lack the flexibility needed for physician input. In this paper, we explore the potential of enhancing segmentation model flexibility by introducing various task prompts through a Large Language Model (LLM) alongside traditional task tokens. Our contribution is in four-fold: (1) we construct a computational-efficient pipeline that uses finetuned language prompts to guide flexible multi-class segmentation; (2) We compare segmentation performance with fixed prompts against free-text; (3) We design a multi-task kidney pathology segmentation dataset and the corresponding various free-text prompts; and (4) We evaluate our approach on the kidney pathology dataset, assessing its capacity to new cases during inference.</p></details> |  |

Although successful, most previous approaches for image classification have crucial drawbacks. There exist numerous tasks in pathology, but one needs to build a model per task, i.e., a task-specific model, thereby increasing the number of models, training resources, and cost. Moreover, transferring arbitrary task-specific model to another task is still a challenging problem. Herein, we propose a task-agnostic generative and general pathology image classifier, so called GPC, that aims at learning from diverse kinds of pathology images and conducting numerous classification tasks in a unified model. GPC, equipped with a convolutional neural network and a Transformer-based language model, maps pathology images into a high-dimensional feature space and generates pertinent class labels as texts via the image-to-text classification mechanism. We evaluate GPC on six datasets for four different pathology image classification tasks. Experimental results show that GPC holds considerable potential for developing an effective and efficient universal model for pathology image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI-MedAGI 2023 (Best Paper Honorable Mention)</p></details> |

Conventional computational pathology formulates and tackles them as independent and individual image classification problems, thereby resulting in computational inefficiency and high costs. To address the challenges, we propose a generic, unified, and universal framework, called a continuous and adaptive learning model in pathology (CAMP), for pathology image classification. CAMP is a generative, efficient, and adaptive classification model that can continuously adapt to any classification task by leveraging pathology-specific prior knowledge and learning taskspecific knowledge with minimal computational cost and without forgetting the knowledge from the existing tasks. We evaluated CAMP on 22 datasets, including 1,171,526 patches and 11,811 pathology slides, across 17 classification tasks. CAMP achieves state-of-theart classification performance on a wide range of datasets and tasks at both patch- and slide-levels and reduces up to 94% of computation time and 85% of storage memory in comparison to the conventional classification models. Our results demonstrate that CAMP can offer a fundamental transformation in pathology image classification, paving the way for the fully digitized and computerized pathology practice.</p></details> | Under review |

With the increase in availability of public foundation models of different sizes, trained using different algorithms on different datasets, it becomes important to establish a benchmark to compare the performance of such models on a variety of clinically relevant tasks spanning multiple organs and diseases. In this work, we present a collection of pathology datasets comprising clinical slides associated with clinically relevant endpoints including cancer diagnoses and a variety of biomarkers generated during standard hospital operation from two medical centers. We leverage these datasets to systematically assess the performance of public pathology foundation models and provide insights into best practices for training new foundation models and selecting appropriate pretrained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.07033</p></details> |

To incorporate the ordering relationship among cancer grades, we introduce a differential ordinal learning problem in which we define and learn the degree of difference in the categorical class labels between pairs of samples by using their differences in the feature space. To this end, we propose a transformer-based neural network that simultaneously conducts both categorical classification and differential ordinal classification for cancer grading. We also propose a tailored loss function for differential ordinal learning. Evaluating the proposed method on three different types of cancer datasets, we demonstrate that the adoption of differential ordinal learning can improve the accuracy and reliability of cancer grading, outperforming conventional cancer grading approaches. The proposed approach should be applicable to other diseases and problems as they involve ordinal relationship among class labels.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, this paper emphasizes the use of CycleGAN for unpaired image-to-image translation, in order to provide an augmentation method able to generate fake pathological images matching an existing ground truth. Although previous studies have employed CycleGAN, they often neglect the challenge of shape deformation, which is crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. Our work introduces an innovative strategy that incorporates additional loss functions. Specifically, it proposes an L1 loss based on the lung surrounding which shape is constrained to remain unchanged at the transition from the healthy to pathological domains. The lung surrounding is derived based on ground truth lung masks available in the healthy domain. Furthermore, preprocessing steps, such as cropping based on ribs/vertebra locations, are applied to refine the input for the CycleGAN, ensuring that the network focus on the lung region. This is essential to avoid extraneous biases, such as the zoom effect bias, which can divert attention from the main task. The method is applied to enhance in semi-supervised manner the lung segmentation process by employing a U-Net model trained with on-the-fly data augmentation incorporating synthetic pathological tissues generated by the CycleGAN model. Preliminary results from this research demonstrate significant qualitative and quantitative improvements, setting a new benchmark in the field of pathological lung segmentation.

| **[Anatomy-guided Pathology Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05844v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological structures in medical images are typically deviations from the expected anatomy of a patient. While clinicians consider this interplay between anatomy and pathology, recent deep learning algorithms specialize in recognizing either one of the two, rarely considering the patient's body from such a joint perspective. In this paper, we develop a generalist segmentation model that combines anatomical and pathological information, aiming to enhance the segmentation accuracy of pathological features. Our Anatomy-Pathology Exchange (APEx) training utilizes a query-based segmentation transformer which decodes a joint feature space into query-representations for human anatomy and interleaves them via a mixing strategy into the pathology-decoder for anatomy-informed pathology predictions.

| **[Unsupervised Latent Stain Adaptation for Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19081v2)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, deep learning (DL) models for tasks such as segmentation or tissue classification are known to suffer from domain shifts due to different staining techniques. Stain adaptation aims to reduce the generalization error between different stains by training a model on source stains that generalizes to target stains. Despite the abundance of target stain data, a key challenge is the lack of annotations. To address this, we propose a joint training between artificially labeled and unlabeled data including all available stained images called Unsupervised Latent Stain Adaptation (ULSA). Our method uses stain translation to enrich labeled source images with synthetic target images in order to increase the supervised signals. Moreover, we leverage unlabeled target stain images using stain-invariant feature consistency learning. With ULSA we present a semi-supervised strategy for efficient stain adaptation without access to annotated target stain data. Remarkably, ULSA is task agnostic in patch-level analysis for whole slide images (WSIs). Through extensive evaluation on external datasets, we demonstrate that ULSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in kidney tissue segmentation and breast cancer classification across a spectrum of staining variations. Our findings suggest that ULSA is an important framework for stain adaptation in computational pathology.</p></details> | Accepted MICCAI2024 |
| **[Characterizing the Interpretability of Attention Maps in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02484v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting machine learning model decisions is crucial for high-risk applications like healthcare. In digital pathology, large whole slide images (WSIs) are decomposed into smaller tiles and tile-derived features are processed by attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) models to predict WSI-level labels. These networks generate tile-specific attention weights, which can be visualized as attention maps for interpretability. However, a standardized evaluation framework for these maps is lacking, questioning their reliability and ability to detect spurious correlations that can mislead models. We herein propose a framework to assess the ability of attention networks to attend to relevant features in digital pathology by creating artificial model confounders and using dedicated interpretability metrics. Models are trained and evaluated on data with tile modifications correlated with WSI labels, enabling the analysis of model sensitivity to artificial confounders and the accuracy of attention maps in highlighting them. Confounders are introduced either through synthetic tile modifications or through tile ablations based on their specific image-based features, with the latter being used to assess more clinically relevant scenarios. We also analyze the impact of varying confounder quantities at both the tile and WSI levels. Our results show that ABMIL models perform as desired within our framework. While attention maps generally highlight relevant regions, their robustness is affected by the type and number of confounders. Our versatile framework has the potential to be used in the evaluation of various methods and the exploration of image-based features driving model predictions, which could aid in biomarker discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[HATs: Hierarchical Adaptive Taxonomy Segmentation for Panoramic Pathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00596v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic image segmentation in computational pathology presents a remarkable challenge due to the morphologically complex and variably scaled anatomy. For instance, the intricate organization in kidney pathology spans multiple layers, from regions like the cortex and medulla to functional units such as glomeruli, tubules, and vessels, down to various cell types. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Adaptive Taxonomy Segmentation (HATs) method, which is designed to thoroughly segment panoramic views of kidney structures by leveraging detailed anatomical insights. Our approach entails (1) the innovative HATs technique which translates spatial relationships among 15 distinct object classes into a versatile "plug-and-play" loss function that spans across regions, functional units, and cells, (2) the incorporation of anatomical hierarchies and scale considerations into a unified simple matrix representation for all panoramic entities, (3) the adoption of the latest AI foundation model (EfficientSAM) as a feature extraction tool to boost the model's adaptability, yet eliminating the need for manual prompt generation in conventional segment anything model (SAM). Experimental findings demonstrate that the HATs method offers an efficient and effective strategy for integrating clinical insights and imaging precedents into a unified segmentation model across more than 15 categories. The official implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/HATs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.19286</p></details> |

Additionally, they can function as vision encoders when combined with large language models (LLMs) to support broader capabilities. Current efforts to train pathology VLMs rely on pathology image-text pairs from platforms like PubMed, YouTube, and Twitter, which provide limited, unscalable data with generally suboptimal image quality. In this work, we leverage large-scale WSI datasets like TCGA to extract numerous high-quality image patches. We then train a large multimodal model to generate captions for these images, creating PathGen-1.6M, a dataset containing 1.6 million high-quality image-caption pairs. Our approach involves multiple agent models collaborating to extract representative WSI patches, generating and refining captions to obtain high-quality image-text pairs. Extensive experiments show that integrating these generated pairs with existing datasets to train a pathology-specific CLIP model, PathGen-CLIP, significantly enhances its ability to analyze pathological images, with substantial improvements across nine pathology-related zero-shot image classification tasks and three whole-slide image tasks. Furthermore, we construct 200K instruction-tuning data based on PathGen-1.6M and integrate PathGen-CLIP with the Vicuna LLM to create more powerful multimodal models through instruction tuning. Overall, we provide a scalable pathway for high-quality data generation in pathology, paving the way for next-generation general pathology models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (PathText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues and achieve competitive performance on certain slide-level tasks. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our collected dataset and related code are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-temporal Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable Pathology Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18310v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology image are essential for accurately interpreting lesion cells in cytopathology screening, but acquiring high-resolution digital slides requires specialized equipment and long scanning times. Though super-resolution (SR) techniques can alleviate this problem, existing deep learning models recover pathology image in a black-box manner, which can lead to untruthful biological details and misdiagnosis. Additionally, current methods allocate the same computational resources to recover each pixel of pathology image, leading to the sub-optimal recovery issue due to the large variation of pathology image. In this paper, we propose the first hierarchical reinforcement learning framework named Spatial-Temporal hierARchical Reinforcement Learning (STAR-RL), mainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in pathology image super-resolution problem. We reformulate the SR problem as a Markov decision process of interpretable operations and adopt the hierarchical recovery mechanism in patch level, to avoid sub-optimal recovery. Specifically, the higher-level spatial manager is proposed to pick out the most corrupted patch for the lower-level patch worker. Moreover, the higher-level temporal manager is advanced to evaluate the selected patch and determine whether the optimization should be stopped earlier, thereby avoiding the over-processed problem. Under the guidance of spatial-temporal managers, the lower-level patch worker processes the selected patch with pixel-wise interpretable actions at each time step. Experimental results on medical images degraded by different kernels show the effectiveness of STAR-RL. Furthermore, STAR-RL validates the promotion in tumor diagnosis with a large margin and shows generalizability under various degradations.

| **[Multimodal Cross-Task Interaction for Survival Analysis in Whole Slide Pathological Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17225v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction, utilizing pathological images and genomic profiles, is increasingly important in cancer analysis and prognosis. Despite significant progress, precise survival analysis still faces two main challenges: (1) The massive pixels contained in whole slide images (WSIs) complicate the process of pathological images, making it difficult to generate an effective representation of the tumor microenvironment (TME). (2) Existing multimodal methods often rely on alignment strategies to integrate complementary information, which may lead to information loss due to the inherent heterogeneity between pathology and genes. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Cross-Task Interaction (MCTI) framework to explore the intrinsic correlations between subtype classification and survival analysis tasks. Specifically, to capture TME-related features in WSIs, we leverage the subtype classification task to mine tumor regions. Simultaneously, multi-head attention mechanisms are applied in genomic feature extraction, adaptively performing genes grouping to obtain task-related genomic embedding. With the joint representation of pathological images and genomic data, we further introduce a Transport-Guided Attention (TGA) module that uses optimal transport theory to model the correlation between subtype classification and survival analysis tasks, effectively transferring potential information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approaches, with MCTI outperforming state-of-the-art frameworks on three public benchmarks. \href{https://github.com/jsh0792/MCTI}{https://github.com/jsh0792/MCTI}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Structured Regression for Non-conformable Spaces: Integrating Pathology Imaging and Genomics Data in Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16721v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial composition and cellular heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. High-definition pathology imaging of tumor biopsies provide a high-resolution view of the spatial organization of different types of cells. This allows for systematic assessment of intra- and inter-patient spatial cellular interactions and heterogeneity by integrating accompanying patient-level genomics data. However, joint modeling across tumor biopsies presents unique challenges due to non-conformability (lack of a common spatial domain across biopsies) as well as high-dimensionality. To address this problem, we propose the Dual random effect and main effect selection model for Spatially structured regression model (DreameSpase). DreameSpase employs a Bayesian variable selection framework that facilitates the assessment of spatial heterogeneity with respect to covariates both within (through fixed effects) and between spaces (through spatial random effects) for non-conformable spatial domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of DreameSpase via simulations and integrative analyses of pathology imaging and gene expression data obtained from $335$ melanoma biopsies. Our findings confirm several existing relationships, e.g. neutrophil genes being associated with both inter- and intra-patient spatial heterogeneity, as well as discovering novel associations. We also provide freely available and computationally efficient software for implementing DreameSpase.</p></details> |  |

As such, there is interest in leveraging AI for automatic, objective assessments of clinical speech to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of speech disorders. We explore transfer learning using foundation models, focusing on the impact of layer selection for the downstream task of predicting pathological speech features. We find that selecting an optimal layer can greatly improve performance (~15.8% increase in balanced accuracy per feature as compared to worst layer, ~13.6% increase as compared to final layer), though the best layer varies by predicted feature and does not always generalize well to unseen data. A learned weighted sum offers comparable performance to the average best layer in-distribution (only ~1.2% lower) and had strong generalization for out-of-distribution data (only 1.5% lower than the average best layer).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Pathology Feature Extractors for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11772v5)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised whole slide image classification is a key task in computational pathology, which involves predicting a slide-level label from a set of image patches constituting the slide. Constructing models to solve this task involves multiple design choices, often made without robust empirical or conclusive theoretical justification. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of feature extractors to answer three critical questions: 1) Is stain normalisation still a necessary preprocessing step? 2) Which feature extractors are best for downstream slide-level classification? 3) How does magnification affect downstream performance? Our study constitutes the most comprehensive evaluation of publicly available pathology feature extractors to date, involving more than 10,000 training runs across 14 feature extractors, 9 tasks, 5 datasets, 3 downstream architectures, 2 levels of magnification, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings challenge existing assumptions: 1) We observe empirically, and by analysing the latent space, that skipping stain normalisation and image augmentations does not degrade performance, while significantly reducing memory and computational demands. 2) We develop a novel evaluation metric to compare relative downstream performance, and show that the choice of feature extractor is the most consequential factor for downstream performance. 3) We find that lower-magnification slides are sufficient for accurate slide-level classification. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level biomarker prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the conference version see: arXiv:2311.11772v4.

This trend reversal occurs for certain choices of the regularization parameter for model training, namely, if the parameter is contained in what we call the pathological regularization regime. For ridge regression, we give necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions on the dataset for the existence of a pathological regularization regime. Moreover, our results provide a data science practitioner with a hands-on tool to avoid hyperparameter choices suffering from trend reversal. We furthermore present numerical results on pathological regularization regimes for logistic regression. Finally, we draw connections to datasets exhibiting Simpson's paradox, providing a natural source of pathological datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Pyramid Channel Attention Network for Pathological Myopia Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09196v3)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological myopia (PM) is the leading ocular disease for impaired vision worldwide. Clinically, the characteristic of pathology distribution in PM is global-local on the fundus image, which plays a significant role in assisting clinicians in diagnosing PM. However, most existing deep neural networks focused on designing complex architectures but rarely explored the pathology distribution prior of PM. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient pyramid channel attention (EPCA) module, which fully leverages the potential of the clinical pathology prior of PM with pyramid pooling and multi-scale context fusion. Then, we construct EPCA-Net for automatic PM recognition based on fundus images by stacking a sequence of EPCA modules. Moreover, motivated by the recent pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm, we attempt to adapt pre-trained natural image models for PM recognition by freezing them and treating the EPCA and other attention modules as adapters. In addition, we construct a PM recognition benchmark termed PM-fundus by collecting fundus images of PM from publicly available datasets. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our EPCA-Net over state-of-the-art methods in the PM recognition task. The results also show that our method based on the pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm achieves competitive performance through comparisons to part of previous methods based on traditional fine-tuning paradigm with fewer tunable parameters, which has the potential to leverage more natural image foundation models to address the PM recognition task in limited medical data regime.</p></details> | 37 pages |

However, existing methods in enabling appropriate AI reliance might encounter challenges while being applied in the medical domain. With this regard, this work employs and provides the validation of an alternative approach -- majority voting -- to facilitate appropriate reliance on AI in medical decision-making. This is achieved by a multi-institutional user study involving 32 medical professionals with various backgrounds, focusing on the pathology task of visually detecting a pattern, mitoses, in tumor images. Here, the majority voting process was conducted by synthesizing decisions under AI assistance from a group of pathology doctors (pathologists). Two metrics were used to evaluate the appropriateness of AI reliance: Relative AI Reliance (RAIR) and Relative Self-Reliance (RSR). Results showed that even with groups of three pathologists, majority-voted decisions significantly increased both RAIR and RSR -- by approximately 9% and 31%, respectively -- compared to decisions made by one pathologist collaborating with AI. This increased appropriateness resulted in better precision and recall in the detection of mitoses. While our study is centered on pathology, we believe these insights can be extended to general high-stakes decision-making processes involving similar visual tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Impact of Speech Mode in Automatic Pathological Speech Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09968v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic pathological speech detection approaches yield promising results in identifying various pathologies. These approaches are typically designed and evaluated for phonetically-controlled speech scenarios, where speakers are prompted to articulate identical phonetic content. While gathering controlled speech recordings can be laborious, spontaneous speech can be conveniently acquired as potential patients navigate their daily routines. Further, spontaneous speech can be valuable in detecting subtle and abstract cues of pathological speech. Nonetheless, the efficacy of automatic pathological speech detection for spontaneous speech remains unexplored. This paper analyzes the influence of speech mode on pathological speech detection approaches, examining two distinct categories of approaches, i.e., classical machine learning and deep learning. Results indicate that classical approaches may struggle to capture pathology-discriminant cues in spontaneous speech. In contrast, deep learning approaches demonstrate superior performance, managing to extract additional cues that were previously inaccessible in non-spontaneous speech</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EUSIPCO 2024</p></details> |

The recent contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model has shown remarkable proficiency in understanding natural images. Drawing inspiration from CLIP, PathCLIP is specifically designed for pathology image analysis, utilizing over 200,000 image and text pairs in training. While the performance the PathCLIP is impressive, its robustness under a wide range of image corruptions remains unknown. Therefore, we conduct an extensive evaluation to analyze the performance of PathCLIP on various corrupted images from the datasets of Osteosarcoma and WSSS4LUAD. In our experiments, we introduce seven corruption types including brightness, contrast, Gaussian blur, resolution, saturation, hue, and markup at four severity levels. Through experiments, we find that PathCLIP is relatively robustness to image corruptions and surpasses OpenAI-CLIP and PLIP in zero-shot classification. Among the seven corruptions, blur and resolution can cause server performance degradation of the PathCLIP. This indicates that ensuring the quality of images is crucial before conducting a clinical test. Additionally, we assess the robustness of PathCLIP in the task of image-image retrieval, revealing that PathCLIP performs less effectively than PLIP on Osteosarcoma but performs better on WSSS4LUAD under diverse corruptions. Overall, PathCLIP presents impressive zero-shot classification and retrieval performance for pathology images, but appropriate care needs to be taken when using it. We hope this study provides a qualitative impression of PathCLIP and helps understand its differences from other CLIP models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in non-destructive 3D pathology, such as open-top light-sheet microscopy, enable comprehensive imaging of spatially heterogeneous tissue morphologies, offering the feasibility to improve diagnostic determinations. A potential early route towards clinical adoption for 3D pathology is to rely on pathologists for final diagnosis based on viewing familiar 2D H&E-like image sections from the 3D datasets. However, manual examination of the massive 3D pathology datasets is infeasible. To address this, we present CARP3D, a deep learning triage approach that automatically identifies the highest-risk 2D slices within 3D volumetric biopsy, enabling time-efficient review by pathologists. For a given slice in the biopsy, we estimate its risk by performing attention-based aggregation of 2D patches within each slice, followed by pooling of the neighboring slices to compute a context-aware 2.5D risk score. For prostate cancer risk stratification, CARP3D achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 90.4% for triaging slices, outperforming methods relying on independent analysis of 2D sections (AUC=81.3%). These results suggest that integrating additional depth context enhances the model's discriminative capabilities. In conclusion, CARP3D has the potential to improve pathologist diagnosis via accurate triage of high-risk slices within large-volume 3D pathology datasets.</p></details> | CVPR CVMI 2024 |

Using two recently collected Dutch datasets with parallel pre and post-surgery audio from the same speaker, NKI-OC-VC and SPOKE, we assess the extent to which speech pathology influences ASV performance, and whether objective/subjective measures of speech severity are correlated with the performance. Finally, we carry out a perceptual study to compare judgements of ASV and human listeners. Our findings reveal that pathological speech negatively affects ASV performance, and the severity of the speech is negatively correlated with the performance. There is a moderate agreement in perceptual and objective scores of speaker similarity and severity, however, we could not clearly establish in the perceptual study, whether the same phenomenon also exists in human perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

Early theoretical work established the soundness and convergence bounds for Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT), the most popular instantiation of MCTS; however, there remain notable gaps in our understanding of how UCT behaves in practice. In this work, we address one such gap by considering the question of whether UCT can exhibit lookahead pathology in adversarial settings -- a paradoxical phenomenon first observed in Minimax search where greater search effort leads to worse decision-making. We introduce a novel family of synthetic games that offer rich modeling possibilities while remaining amenable to mathematical analysis. Our theoretical and experimental results suggest that UCT is indeed susceptible to pathological behavior in a range of games drawn from this family.</p></details> |  |

A major factor rendering MR inaccessible is lengthy scan times. An MR scanner collects measurements associated with the underlying anatomy in the Fourier space, also known as the k-space. Creating a high-fidelity image requires collecting large quantities of such measurements, increasing the scan time. Traditionally to accelerate an MR scan, image reconstruction from under-sampled k-space data is the method of choice. However, recent works show the feasibility of bypassing image reconstruction and directly learning to detect disease directly from a sparser learned subset of the k-space measurements. In this work, we propose Adaptive Sampling for MR (ASMR), a sampling method that learns an adaptive policy to sequentially select k-space samples to optimize for target disease detection. On 6 out of 8 pathology classification tasks spanning the Knee, Brain, and Prostate MR scans, ASMR reaches within 2% of the performance of a fully sampled classifier while using only 8% of the k-space, as well as outperforming prior state-of-the-art work in k-space sampling such as EMRT, LOUPE, and DPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

This study presents a model that predicts pCR in breast cancer patients using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Radiomics features are established hand-crafted features of the tumor region and thus could be useful in medical image analysis.

| **[Inpainting Pathology in Lumbar Spine MRI with Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02477v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data driven models for automated diagnosis in radiology suffer from insufficient and imbalanced datasets due to low representation of pathology in a population and the cost of expert annotations. Datasets can be bolstered through data augmentation. However, even when utilizing a full suite of transformations during model training, typical data augmentations do not address variations in human anatomy. An alternative direction is to synthesize data using generative models, which can potentially craft datasets with specific attributes. While this holds promise, commonly used generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks may inadvertently produce anatomically inaccurate features. On the other hand, diffusion models, which offer greater stability, tend to memorize training data, raising concerns about privacy and generative diversity. Alternatively, inpainting has the potential to augment data through directly inserting pathology in medical images. However, this approach introduces a new challenge: accurately merging the generated pathological features with the surrounding anatomical context. While inpainting is a well established method for addressing simple lesions, its application to pathologies that involve complex structural changes remains relatively unexplored. We propose an efficient method for inpainting pathological features onto healthy anatomy in MRI through voxelwise noise scheduling in a latent diffusion model. We evaluate the method's ability to insert disc herniation and central canal stenosis in lumbar spine sagittal T2 MRI, and it achieves superior Frechet Inception Distance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, PET's high costs and radiation exposure limit its widespread use. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not have these limitations. Although it also captures neurodegenerative changes, MRI is a less sensitive diagnostic tool than PET. To close this gap, we aim to generate synthetic PET from MRI. Herewith, we introduce PASTA, a novel pathology-aware image translation framework based on conditional diffusion models. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PASTA excels in preserving both structural and pathological details in the target modality, which is achieved through its highly interactive dual-arm architecture and multi-modal condition integration. A cycle exchange consistency and volumetric generation strategy elevate PASTA's capability to produce high-quality 3D PET scans. Our qualitative and quantitative results confirm that the synthesized PET scans from PASTA not only reach the best quantitative scores but also preserve the pathology correctly. For Alzheimer's classification, the performance of synthesized scans improves over MRI by 4%, almost reaching the performance of actual PET.

| **[Equipping Computational Pathology Systems with Artifact Processing Pipelines: A Showcase for Computation and Performance Trade-offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07743v3)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology is a gold standard for cancer diagnosis under a microscopic examination. However, histological tissue processing procedures result in artifacts, which are ultimately transferred to the digitized version of glass slides, known as whole slide images (WSIs). Artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant areas and may result in wrong deep learning (DL) algorithms predictions. Therefore, detecting and excluding artifacts in the computational pathology (CPATH) system is essential for reliable automated diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) scheme for detecting five notable artifacts, including damaged tissue, blur, folded tissue, air bubbles, and histologically irrelevant blood from WSIs. First, we train independent binary DL models as experts to capture particular artifact morphology. Then, we ensemble their predictions using a fusion mechanism. We apply probabilistic thresholding over the final probability distribution to improve the sensitivity of the MoE. We developed DL pipelines using two MoEs and two multiclass models of state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). DCNNs-based MoE and ViTs-based MoE schemes outperformed simpler multiclass models and were tested on datasets from different hospitals and cancer types, where MoE using DCNNs yielded the best results. The proposed MoE yields 86.15% F1 and 97.93% sensitivity scores on unseen data, retaining less computational cost for inference than MoE using ViTs. This best performance of MoEs comes with relatively higher computational trade-offs than multiclass models. The proposed artifact detection pipeline will not only ensure reliable CPATH predictions but may also provide quality control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making Journal</p></details> |

Methods We analyzed 1,410 surgical pathology reports from adult papillary thyroid cancer patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from 2010 to 2019. Structured and non-structured reports were used to create a consensus-based ground truth dictionary and categorized them into modified recurrence risk levels. Non-structured reports were narrative, while structured reports followed standardized formats. We then developed ThyroPath, a rule-based NLP pipeline, to extract and classify thyroid cancer features into risk categories. Training involved 225 reports (150 structured, 75 unstructured), with testing on 170 reports (120 structured, 50 unstructured) for evaluation. The pipeline's performance was assessed using both strict and lenient criteria for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results In extraction tasks, ThyroPath achieved overall strict F-1 scores of 93% for structured reports and 90 for unstructured reports, covering 18 thyroid cancer pathology features. In classification tasks, ThyroPath-extracted information demonstrated an overall accuracy of 93% in categorizing reports based on their corresponding guideline-based risk of recurrence: 76.9% for high-risk, 86.8% for intermediate risk, and 100% for both low and very low-risk cases. However, ThyroPath achieved 100% accuracy across all thyroid cancer risk categories with human-extracted pathology information. Conclusions ThyroPath shows promise in automating the extraction and risk recurrence classification of thyroid pathology reports at large scale. It offers a solution to laborious manual reviews and advancing virtual registries. However, it requires further validation before implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Multiple Instance Learning: Full Resolution All-In-Memory End-To-End Pathology Slide Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04865v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential to improve health outcomes by training systems on vast digitized clinical datasets. Computational Pathology, with its massive amounts of microscopy image data and impact on diagnostics and biomarkers, is at the forefront of this development. Gigapixel pathology slides pose a unique challenge due to their enormous size and are usually divided into tens of thousands of smaller tiles for analysis. This results in a discontinuity in the machine learning process by separating the training of tile-level encoders from slide-level aggregators and the need to adopt weakly supervised learning strategies. Training models from entire pathology slides end-to-end has been largely unexplored due to its computational challenges. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach to jointly train both a tile encoder and a slide-aggregator fully in memory and end-to-end at high-resolution, bridging the gap between input and slide-level supervision. While more computationally expensive, detailed quantitative validation shows promise for large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning of pathology foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Morphological Prototyping for Unsupervised Slide Representation Learning in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11643v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) has been has primarily relied on weak supervision with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). However, the slide representations resulting from this approach are highly tailored to specific clinical tasks, which limits their expressivity and generalization, particularly in scenarios with limited data. Instead, we hypothesize that morphological redundancy in tissue can be leveraged to build a task-agnostic slide representation in an unsupervised fashion. To this end, we introduce PANTHER, a prototype-based approach rooted in the Gaussian mixture model that summarizes the set of WSI patches into a much smaller set of morphological prototypes. Specifically, each patch is assumed to have been generated from a mixture distribution, where each mixture component represents a morphological exemplar. Utilizing the estimated mixture parameters, we then construct a compact slide representation that can be readily used for a wide range of downstream tasks. By performing an extensive evaluation of PANTHER on subtyping and survival tasks using 13 datasets, we show that 1) PANTHER outperforms or is on par with supervised MIL baselines and 2) the analysis of morphological prototypes brings new qualitative and quantitative insights into model interpretability.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[Detecting Domain Shift in Multiple Instance Learning for Digital Pathology Using Fréchet Domain Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09934v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-instance learning (MIL) is an attractive approach for digital pathology applications as it reduces the costs related to data collection and labelling. However, it is not clear how sensitive MIL is to clinically realistic domain shifts, i.e., differences in data distribution that could negatively affect performance, and if already existing metrics for detecting domain shifts work well with these algorithms. We trained an attention-based MIL algorithm to classify whether a whole-slide image of a lymph node contains breast tumour metastases. The algorithm was evaluated on data from a hospital in a different country and various subsets of this data that correspond to different levels of domain shift. Our contributions include showing that MIL for digital pathology is affected by clinically realistic differences in data, evaluating which features from a MIL model are most suitable for detecting changes in performance, and proposing an unsupervised metric named Fr\'echet Domain Distance (FDD) for quantification of domain shifts. Shift measure performance was evaluated through the mean Pearson correlation to change in classification performance, where FDD achieved 0.70 on 10-fold cross-validation models. The baselines included Deep ensemble, Difference of Confidence, and Representation shift which resulted in 0.45, -0.29, and 0.56 mean Pearson correlation, respectively. FDD could be a valuable tool for care providers and vendors who need to verify if a MIL system is likely to perform reliably when implemented at a new site, without requiring any additional annotations from pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selfsupervised learning for pathological speech detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02572v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech production is a complex phenomenon, wherein the brain orchestrates a sequence of processes involving thought processing, motor planning, and the execution of articulatory movements. However, this intricate execution of various processes is susceptible to influence and disruption by various neurodegenerative pathological speech disorders, such as Parkinsons' disease, resulting in dysarthria, apraxia, and other conditions. These disorders lead to pathological speech characterized by abnormal speech patterns and imprecise articulation. Diagnosing these speech disorders in clinical settings typically involves auditory perceptual tests, which are time-consuming, and the diagnosis can vary among clinicians based on their experiences, biases, and cognitive load during the diagnosis. Additionally, unlike neurotypical speakers, patients with speech pathologies or impairments are unable to access various virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri, etc. To address these challenges, several automatic pathological speech detection (PSD) approaches have been proposed. These approaches aim to provide efficient and accurate detection of speech disorders, thereby facilitating timely intervention and support for individuals affected by these conditions. These approaches mainly vary in two aspects: the input representations utilized and the classifiers employed. Due to the limited availability of data, the performance of detection remains subpar. Self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, such as wav2vec2, and their multilingual versions, are being explored as a promising avenue to improve performance. These embeddings leverage self-supervised learning techniques to extract rich representations from audio data, thereby offering a potential solution to address the limitations posed by the scarcity of labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>in In...</summary><p>in Intersection of Book Chapter in Machine Leanring and Computational Social Sciences CRC (in progress) 2024</p></details> |
| **[PLUTO: Pathology-Universal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07905v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology is the study of microscopic inspection of tissue, and a pathology diagnosis is often the medical gold standard to diagnose disease. Pathology images provide a unique challenge for computer-vision-based analysis: a single pathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) is gigapixel-sized and often contains hundreds of thousands to millions of objects of interest across multiple resolutions. In this work, we propose PathoLogy Universal TransfOrmer (PLUTO): a light-weight pathology FM that is pre-trained on a diverse dataset of 195 million image tiles collected from multiple sites and extracts meaningful representations across multiple WSI scales that enable a large variety of downstream pathology tasks. In particular, we design task-specific adaptation heads that utilize PLUTO's output embeddings for tasks which span pathology scales ranging from subcellular to slide-scale, including instance segmentation, tile classification, and slide-level prediction. We compare PLUTO's performance to other state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of external and internal benchmarks covering multiple biologically relevant tasks, tissue types, resolutions, stains, and scanners. We find that PLUTO matches or outperforms existing task-specific baselines and pathology-specific foundation models, some of which use orders-of-magnitude larger datasets and model sizes when compared to PLUTO. Our findings present a path towards a universal embedding to power pathology image analysis, and motivate further exploration around pathology foundation models in terms of data diversity, architectural improvements, sample efficiency, and practical deployability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Multiparametric MRI with Optimized Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging to Enhance Breast Cancer Pathologic Complete Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07854v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 2020, 685,000 deaths across the world were attributed to breast cancer, underscoring the critical need for innovative and effective breast cancer treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has recently gained popularity as a promising treatment strategy for breast cancer, attributed to its efficacy in shrinking large tumors and leading to pathologic complete response. However, the current process to recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy relies on the subjective evaluation of medical experts which contain inherent biases and significant uncertainty. A recent study, utilizing volumetric deep radiomic features extracted from synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$), demonstrated significant potential in noninvasive breast cancer pathologic complete response prediction. Inspired by the positive outcomes of optimizing CDI$^s$ for prostate cancer delineation, this research investigates the application of optimized CDI$^s$ to enhance breast cancer pathologic complete response prediction. Using multiparametric MRI that fuses optimized CDI$^s$ with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), we obtain a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 93.28%, over 5.5% higher than that previously reported.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce GaitMotion, a multitask dataset leveraging wearable sensors to capture the patients' real-time movement with pathological gait. This dataset offers extensive ground-truth labeling for multiple tasks, including step/stride segmentation and step/stride length prediction, empowers researchers with a more holistic understanding of gait disturbances linked to neurological impairments. The wearable gait analysis suit captures the gait cycle, pattern, and parameters for both normal and pathological subjects. This data may prove beneficial for healthcare products focused on patient progress monitoring and post-disease recovery, as well as for forensics technologies aimed at person reidentification, and biomechanics research to aid in the development of humanoid robotics. Moreover, the analysis has considered the drift in data distribution across individual subjects. This drift can be attributed to each participant's unique behavioral habits or potential displacement of the sensor. Stride length variance for normal, Parkinson's, and stroke patients are compared to recognize the pathological walking pattern. As the baseline and benchmark, we provide an error of 14.1, 13.3, and 12.2 centimeters of stride length prediction for normal, Parkinson's, and Stroke gaits separately. We also analyzed the gait characteristics for normal and pathological gaits in terms of the gait cycle and gait parameters.</p></details> |  |

The outcomes reveal a 100% success rate in manipulating PLIP's predictions, underscoring its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. The qualitative analysis of adversarial examples delves into the interpretability challenges, shedding light on nuanced changes in predictions induced by adversarial manipulations.

The unstructured nature of these reports presents a significant challenge limiting the accessibility of their content. In this work, we present a practical approach based on the use of large multimodal models (LMMs) for automatically extracting information from scanned images of pathology reports with the goal of generating a standardised report specifying the value of different fields along with estimated confidence about the accuracy of the extracted fields. The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods which do not assign confidence scores to extracted fields limiting their practical use. The proposed framework uses two stages of prompting a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for information extraction and validation. The framework generalises to textual reports from multiple medical centres as well as scanned images of legacy pathology reports. We show that the estimated confidence is an effective indicator of the accuracy of the extracted information that can be used to select only accurately extracted fields. We also show the prognostic significance of structured and unstructured data from pathology reports and show that the automatically extracted field values significant prognostic value for patient stratification. The framework is available for evaluation via the URL: https://labieb.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

In this work, we present an investigation of modifications to SSL for pathology data, specifically focusing on the DINOv2 algorithm. We propose alternative augmentations, regularization functions, and position encodings motivated by the characteristics of pathology images.

For this, we propose a deep learning (DL) system that learns from weak labels, a sampling strategy that reduces the number of training samples by a factor of six without compromising performance, an approach to leverage a small subset of fully annotated samples, and a prototype with explainable predictions, active learning features and parallelisation. Noting some problems in the literature, this study is conducted with one of the largest WSI colorectal samples dataset with approximately 10,500 WSIs. Of these samples, 900 are testing samples. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed method is assessed with two additional external datasets (TCGA and PAIP) and a dataset of samples collected directly from the proposed prototype. Our proposed method predicts, for the patch-based tiles, a class based on the severity of the dysplasia and uses that information to classify the whole slide. It is trained with an interpretable mixed-supervision scheme to leverage the domain knowledge introduced by pathologists through spatial annotations. The mixed-supervision scheme allowed for an intelligent sampling strategy effectively evaluated in several different scenarios without compromising the performance. On the internal dataset, the method shows an accuracy of 93.44% and a sensitivity between positive (low-grade and high-grade dysplasia) and non-neoplastic samples of 0.996. On the external test samples varied with TCGA being the most challenging dataset with an overall accuracy of 84.91% and a sensitivity of 0.996.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at npj Precision Oncology.

According to the WHO, nearly 18 million people decease each year because of heart diseases. Also considering the increase of medical data, much pressure is put on the health industry to develop systems for early and accurate heart disease recognition. In this work, an automatic cardiac pathology recognition system based on a novel deep learning framework is proposed, which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences. The system works in two stages. The first one transforms the data included in a database of echocardiography sequences into a machine-learning-compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in the training stage of any kind of machine learning-based framework, and more specifically with deep learning. This includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, for both data augmentation and feature extraction in the medical field. The second stage is focused on building and training a Vision Transformer (ViT), barely explored in the related literature. The ViT is adapted for an effective training from scratch, even with small datasets. The designed neural network analyses images from an echocardiography sequence to predict the heart state. The results obtained show the superiority of the proposed system and the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm, even outperforming pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are so far the method of choice in the literature.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we introduce a comprehensive rubric based on various dimensions of speech quality, including phonetics, fluency, and prosody. The objective is to establish standardized criteria for identifying errors within the speech of individuals with Down syndrome, thereby enabling the development of automated assessment systems. To achieve this objective, we utilized the Prautocal corpus. To assess the quality of annotations using our rubric, two experiments were conducted, focusing on phonetics and fluency. For phonetic evaluation, we employed the Goodness of Pronunciation (GoP) metric, utilizing automatic segmentation systems and correlating the results with evaluations conducted by a specialized speech therapist. While the obtained correlation values were not notably high, a positive trend was observed. In terms of fluency assessment, deep learning models like wav2vec were used to extract audio features, and we employed an SVM classifier trained on a corpus focused on identifying fluency issues to categorize Prautocal corpus samples. The outcomes highlight the complexities of evaluating such phenomena, with variability depending on the specific type of disfluency detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |
| **[Autonomous Quality and Hallucination Assessment for Virtual Tissue Staining and Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18458v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential in the diagnosis of various diseases. The recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using AI alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in the traditional histochemical staining process, permitting multiplexed rapid staining of label-free tissue without using staining reagents, while also preserving tissue. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical utility of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images is generally performed by human experts, which can be subjective and depends on the training level of the expert. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method (termed AQuA), mainly designed for virtual tissue staining, while also being applicable to histochemical staining. AQuA achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to ground truth, also presenting an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists. Besides, AQuA achieves super-human performance in identifying realistic-looking, virtually stained hallucinatory images that would normally mislead human diagnosticians by deceiving them into diagnosing patients that never existed. We further demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained tissue images and showcase its strong external generalization to detect unseen hallucination patterns of virtual staining network models as well as artifacts observed in the traditional histochemical staining workflow. This framework creates new opportunities to enhance the reliability of virtual staining and will provide quality assurance for various image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.</p></details> | 37 Pages, 7 Figures |

| **[Foundation Models -- A Panacea for Artificial Intelligence in Pathology?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21264v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948; updated authors list format</p></details> |

The field of WSI analysis is confronted with a severe long-tailed distribution problem, which significantly impacts the performance of classifiers. Long-tailed distributions lead to class imbalance, where some classes have sparse samples while others are abundant, making it difficult for classifiers to accurately identify minority class samples. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble learning method based on MIL, which employs expert decoders with shared aggregators and consistency constraints to learn diverse distributions and reduce the impact of class imbalance on classifier performance. Moreover, we introduce a multimodal distillation framework that leverages text encoders pre-trained on pathology-text pairs to distill knowledge and guide the MIL aggregator in capturing stronger semantic features relevant to class information. To ensure flexibility, we use learnable prompts to guide the distillation process of the pre-trained text encoder, avoiding limitations imposed by specific prompts. Our method, MDE-MIL, integrates multiple expert branches focusing on specific data distributions to address long-tailed issues. Consistency control ensures generalization across classes. Multimodal distillation enhances feature extraction. Experiments on Camelyon+-LT and PANDA-LT datasets show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources.

We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date.

| **["No negatives needed": weakly-supervised regression for interpretable tumor detection in whole-slide histopathology images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21109v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate tumor detection in digital pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as a widely used approach for weakly-supervised tumor detection with large-scale data without the need for manual annotations. However, traditional MIL methods often depend on classification tasks that require tumor-free cases as negative examples, which are challenging to obtain in real-world clinical workflows, especially for surgical resection specimens. We address this limitation by reformulating tumor detection as a regression task, estimating tumor percentages from WSIs, a clinically available target across multiple cancer types. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the proposed weakly-supervised regression framework by applying it to multiple organs, specimen types and clinical scenarios. We characterize the robustness of our framework to tumor percentage as a noisy regression target, and introduce a novel concept of amplification technique to improve tumor detection sensitivity when learning from small tumor regions. Finally, we provide interpretable insights into the model's predictions by analyzing visual attention and logit maps. Our code is available at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/tumor-percentage-mil-regression.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in domain generalization improve model transferability in terms of aggregated performance measured by the Area Under Curve (AUC). However, clinical regulations often require to control the transferability of other metrics, such as prescribed sensitivity levels. We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Validated across multiple cohorts and tasks, our method enables robust sensitivity control with only a handful of calibration samples, providing a practical solution for reliable deployment of computational pathology systems.</p></details> | Preprint |

| **[Can We Simplify Slide-level Fine-tuning of Pathology Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20823v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed histopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis being a core application. Traditionally, weakly supervised fine-tuning via multiple instance learning (MIL) has been the primary method for adapting foundation models to WSIs. However, in this work we present a key experimental finding: a simple nonlinear mapping strategy combining mean pooling and a multilayer perceptron, called SiMLP, can effectively adapt patch-level foundation models to slide-level tasks without complex MIL-based learning. Through extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of SiMLP with state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on a large-scale pan-cancer classification task, SiMLP surpasses popular MIL-based methods by 3.52%. Furthermore, SiMLP shows strong learning ability in few-shot classification and remaining highly competitive with slide-level foundation models pretrained on tens of thousands of slides. Finally, SiMLP exhibits remarkable robustness and transferability in lung cancer subtyping. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional MIL-based fine-tuning paradigm, demonstrating that a task-agnostic representation strategy alone can effectively adapt foundation models to WSI analysis. These insights offer a unique and meaningful perspective for future research in digital pathology, paving the way for more efficient and broadly applicable methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

There is high heterogeneity in tissue appearance, significant class imbalance in favor of benign examples, and scarcity in the number and quality of ground truth annotations available to train models. Failure to address even a single one of these problems can result in unacceptable clinical outcomes.We propose TRUSWorthy, a carefully designed, tuned, and integrated system for reliable PCa detection. Our pipeline integrates self-supervised learning, multiple-instance learning aggregation using transformers, random-undersampled boosting and ensembling: these address label scarcity, weak labels, class imbalance, and overconfidence, respectively. We train and rigorously evaluate our method using a large, multi-center dataset of micro-ultrasound data. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of accuracy and uncertainty calibration, with AUROC and balanced accuracy scores of 79.9% and 71.5%, respectively. On the top 20% of predictions with the highest confidence, we can achieve a balanced accuracy of up to 91%. The success of TRUSWorthy demonstrates the potential of integrated deep learning solutions to meet clinical needs in a highly challenging deployment setting, and is a significant step towards creating a trustworthy system for computer-assisted PCa diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IJCARS.

Most prior work employs satellite imagery for county-level corn yield prediction by spatially aggregating all pixels within a county into a single value, potentially overlooking the detailed information and valuable insights offered by more granular data. To this end, this research examines each county at the pixel level and applies multiple instance learning to leverage detailed information within a county. In addition, our method addresses the "mixed pixel" issue caused by the inconsistent resolution between feature datasets and crop mask, which may introduce noise into the model and therefore hinder accurate yield prediction. Specifically, the attention mechanism is employed to automatically assign weights to different pixels, which can mitigate the influence of mixed pixels. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms four other machine learning models over the past five years in the U.S. corn belt and demonstrates its best performance in 2022, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.84 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83. This paper demonstrates the advantages of our approach from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, through an in-depth study of the relationship between mixed pixels and attention, it is verified that our approach can capture critical feature information while filtering out noise from mixed pixels.</p></details> | <details><summary>I am ...</summary><p>I am writing to request the resubmission of my paper submitted to arXiv</p></details> |
| **[PathFinder: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent System for Medical Diagnostic Decision-Making Applied to Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08916v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing diseases through histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is fundamental in modern pathology but is challenged by the gigapixel scale and complexity of WSIs. Trained histopathologists overcome this challenge by navigating the WSI, looking for relevant patches, taking notes, and compiling them to produce a final holistic diagnostic. Traditional AI approaches, such as multiple instance learning and transformer-based models, fail short of such a holistic, iterative, multi-scale diagnostic procedure, limiting their adoption in the real-world. We introduce PathFinder, a multi-modal, multi-agent framework that emulates the decision-making process of expert pathologists. PathFinder integrates four AI agents, the Triage Agent, Navigation Agent, Description Agent, and Diagnosis Agent, that collaboratively navigate WSIs, gather evidence, and provide comprehensive diagnoses with natural language explanations. The Triage Agent classifies the WSI as benign or risky; if risky, the Navigation and Description Agents iteratively focus on significant regions, generating importance maps and descriptive insights of sampled patches. Finally, the Diagnosis Agent synthesizes the findings to determine the patient's diagnostic classification. Our Experiments show that PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skin melanoma diagnosis by 8% while offering inherent explainability through natural language descriptions of diagnostically relevant patches. Qualitative analysis by pathologists shows that the Description Agent's outputs are of high quality and comparable to GPT-4o. PathFinder is also the first AI-based system to surpass the average performance of pathologists in this challenging melanoma classification task by 9%, setting a new record for efficient, accurate, and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostics in pathology.

Although rumor detection and stance detection are distinct tasks, they can complement each other. Rumors can be identified by cross-referencing stances in related posts, and stances are influenced by the nature of the rumor. However, existing stance detection methods often require post-level stance annotations, which are costly to obtain. We propose a novel LLM-enhanced MIL approach to jointly predict post stance and claim class labels, supervised solely by claim labels, using an undirected microblog propagation model. Our weakly supervised approach relies only on bag-level labels of claim veracity, aligning with multi-instance learning (MIL) principles. To achieve this, we transform the multi-class problem into multiple MIL-based binary classification problems. We then employ a discriminative attention layer to aggregate the outputs from these classifiers into finer-grained classes. Experiments conducted on three rumor datasets and two stance datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting strong connections between rumor veracity and expressed stances in responding posts. Our method shows promising performance in joint rumor and stance detection compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM TIST |

However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning with Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02707v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology often neglects instance-level learning as supervision is typically provided only at the bag level. In this work, we present PathMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information on bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm, to probe and distil a classifier trained with bag-level information to obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the supervision for the same classifier in a finer way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose Two-Dimensional Positional Encoding (2DPE), which encodes the spatial appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. PathMIL is evaluated on multiple benchmarking tasks, including subtype classification (TCGA-NSCLC), tumour classification (CAMELYON16), and an internal benchmark for breast cancer receptor status classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with AUC scores of 0.9152 and 0.8524 for estrogen and progesterone receptor status classification, respectively, an AUC of 0.9618 for subtype classification, and 0.8634 for tumour classification, surpassing existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Milmer: a Framework for Multiple Instance Learning based Multimodal Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00547v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotions play a crucial role in human behavior and decision-making, making emotion recognition a key area of interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). This study addresses the challenges of emotion recognition by integrating facial expression analysis with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, introducing a novel multimodal framework-Milmer. The proposed framework employs a transformer-based fusion approach to effectively integrate visual and physiological modalities. It consists of an EEG preprocessing module, a facial feature extraction and balancing module, and a cross-modal fusion module. To enhance visual feature extraction, we fine-tune a pre-trained Swin Transformer on emotion-related datasets. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism is introduced to balance token representation across modalities, ensuring effective feature integration. A key innovation of this work is the adoption of a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, which extracts meaningful information from multiple facial expression images over time, capturing critical temporal dynamics often overlooked in previous studies. Extensive experiments conducted on the DEAP dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.72% in the four-class emotion recognition task. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of each module, highlighting the significance of advanced feature extraction and fusion strategies in enhancing emotion recognition performance.

This paper pioneers EEG-language models (ELMs) trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We propose to combine multimodal alignment in this novel domain with timeseries cropping and text segmentation, enabling an extension based on multiple instance learning to alleviate misalignment between irrelevant EEG or text segments. Our multimodal models significantly improve pathology detection compared to EEG-only models across four evaluations and for the first time enable zero-shot classification as well as retrieval of both neural signals and reports. In sum, these results highlight the potential of ELMs, representing significant progress for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Graph-based MIL and Interventional Training in the Generalization of WSI Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19048v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Imaging (WSI), which involves high-resolution digital scans of pathology slides, has become the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, but its gigapixel resolution and the scarcity of annotated datasets present challenges for deep learning models. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a widely-used weakly supervised approach, bypasses the need for patch-level annotations. However, conventional MIL methods overlook the spatial relationships between patches, which are crucial for tasks such as cancer grading and diagnosis. To address this, graph-based approaches have gained prominence by incorporating spatial information through node connections. Despite their potential, both MIL and graph-based models are vulnerable to learning spurious associations, like color variations in WSIs, affecting their robustness. In this dissertation, we conduct an extensive comparison of multiple graph construction techniques, MIL models, graph-MIL approaches, and interventional training, introducing a new framework, Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning with Interventional Training (GMIL-IT), for WSI classification. We evaluate their impact on model generalization through domain shift analysis and demonstrate that graph-based models alone achieve the generalization initially anticipated from interventional training.

The microenvironment and specific tissue structures are essential for pathologists to predict the primary bone cancer origins and primary bone cancer subtyping. By digitizing bone tissue sections into whole slide images (WSIs) and leveraging deep learning to model slide embeddings, this analysis can be enhanced. However, tumor metastasis involves complex multivariate interactions with diverse bone tissue structures, which traditional WSI analysis methods such as multiple instance learning (MIL) fail to capture. Moreover, graph neural networks (GNNs), limited to modeling pairwise relationships, are hard to represent high-order biological associations. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic hypergraph neural network (DyHG) that overcomes the edge construction limitations of traditional graph representations by connecting multiple nodes via hyperedges. A low-rank strategy is used to reduce the complexity of parameters in learning hypergraph structures, while a Gumbel-Softmax-based sampling strategy optimizes the patch distribution across hyperedges. An MIL aggregator is then used to derive a graph-level embedding for comprehensive WSI analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of DyHG, we construct two large-scale datasets for primary bone cancer origins and subtyping classification based on real-world bone metastasis scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyHG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, showcasing its ability to model complex biological interactions and improve the accuracy of bone metastasis analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages,11 figures |

However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, a key limitation of MIL lies in the underexplored potential of pre-training the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches train it from scratch, resulting in performance heavily dependent on the number of labeled WSIs, while overlooking the abundance of unlabeled WSIs available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating HIPT into PreMix achieves an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training datasets and label sizes. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset; 2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We hope that these insights can provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of the current SOTA pathology foundation models. Furthermore, this work may inform the development of more effective pathology foundation models.

In this study, we propose MEDFORM, a multimodal pre-training strategy that guides CT image representation learning using complementary information from clinical data for medical foundation model development. MEDFORM efficiently processes CT slice through multiple instance learning (MIL) and adopts a dual pre-training strategy: first pretraining the CT slice feature extractor using SimCLR-based self-supervised learning, then aligning CT and clinical modalities through cross-modal contrastive learning. Our model was pre-trained on three different cancer types: lung cancer (141,171 slices), breast cancer (8,100 slices), colorectal cancer (10,393 slices). The experimental results demonstrated that this dual pre-training strategy improves cancer classification performance and maintains robust performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

Given their reliance on classification objectives, traditional WSOL methods like class activation mapping focus on the most discriminative object parts, often missing the full spatial extent. In contrast, recent WSOL methods based on vision-language models like CLIP require ground truth classes or external classifiers to produce a localization map, limiting their deployment in downstream tasks. Moreover, methods like GenPromp attempt to address these issues but introduce considerable complexity due to their reliance on conditional denoising processes and intricate prompt learning. This paper introduces Text Distillation for Localization (TeD-Loc), an approach that directly distills knowledge from CLIP text embeddings into the model backbone and produces patch-level localization. Multiple instance learning of these image patches allows for accurate localization and classification using one model without requiring external classifiers. Such integration of textual and visual modalities addresses the longstanding challenge of achieving accurate localization and classification concurrently, as WSOL methods in the literature typically converge at different epochs. Extensive experiments show that leveraging text embeddings and localization cues provides a cost-effective WSOL model. TeD-Loc improves Top-1 LOC accuracy over state-of-the-art models by about 5% on both CUB and ILSVRC datasets, while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to GenPromp.</p></details> |  |

In this context, this study explores the feature extraction ability of different pre-training strategies for distinguishing ES from other soft tissue or bone sarcomas with similar morphology in digitized tissue microarrays for the first time, as far as we know. Vision-language supervision (VLS) is compared to fully-supervised ImageNet pre-training within a multiple instance learning paradigm. Our findings indicate a substantial improvement in diagnostic accuracy with the adaption of VLS using an in-domain dataset.

Among these approaches, multimodal violence detection, which integrates modalities such as audio and optical flow, holds great potential. Existing methods in this domain primarily focus on designing multimodal fusion models to address modality discrepancies. In contrast, we take a different approach; leveraging the inherent discrepancies across modalities in violence event representation to propose a novel multimodal semantic feature alignment method. This method sparsely maps the semantic features of local, transient, and less informative modalities ( such as audio and optical flow ) into the more informative RGB semantic feature space. Through an iterative process, the method identifies the suitable no-zero feature matching subspace and aligns the modality-specific event representations based on this subspace, enabling the full exploitation of information from all modalities during the subsequent modality fusion stage. Building on this, we design a new weakly supervised violence detection framework that consists of unimodal multiple-instance learning for extracting unimodal semantic features, multimodal alignment, multimodal fusion, and final detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an average precision (AP) of 86.07% on the XD-Violence dataset.

However, most weakly supervised methods either involve a strong downsampling of input images, or only achieve localization at a coarse resolution, both of which are unsatisfactory for small structures. We propose a novel framework that increases the spatial resolution of a traditional attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach by using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to prompt the Segment Anything Model (SAM~2), and increases recall with iterative inference. Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing MIL with a Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT), which adds a positional encoding, and permits an exchange of information between different regions of the OCT image, leads to a further and substantial increase in segmentation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, accepted at German Conference on Medical Image Computing 2025</p></details> |

In histopathology, MIL models have achieved remarkable success in tasks like tumor detection, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognostication. However, MIL explanation methods are still lagging behind, as they are limited to small bag sizes or disregard instance interactions. We revisit MIL through the lens of explainable AI (XAI) and introduce xMIL, a refined framework with more general assumptions. We demonstrate how to obtain improved MIL explanations using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and conduct extensive evaluation experiments on three toy settings and four real-world histopathology datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms previous explanation attempts with particularly improved faithfulness scores on challenging biomarker prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase how xMIL explanations enable pathologists to extract insights from MIL models, representing a significant advance for knowledge discovery and model debugging in digital histopathology.

Interpretability is crucial for safely deploying such algorithms in high-stakes medical domains. Traditional MIL methods offer explanations by highlighting salient regions. However, such spatial heatmaps provide limited insights for end users. To address this, we propose a novel inherently interpretable WSI-classification approach that uses human-understandable pathology concepts to generate explanations. Our proposed Concept MIL model leverages recent advances in vision-language models to directly predict pathology concepts based on image features. The model's predictions are obtained through a linear combination of the concepts identified on the top-K patches of a WSI, enabling inherent explanations by tracing each concept's influence on the prediction. In contrast to traditional concept-based interpretable models, our approach eliminates the need for costly human annotations by leveraging the vision-language model. We validate our method on two widely used pathology datasets: Camelyon16 and PANDA. On both datasets, Concept MIL achieves AUC and accuracy scores over 0.9, putting it on par with state-of-the-art models. We further find that 87.1\% (Camelyon16) and 85.3\% (PANDA) of the top 20 patches fall within the tumor region. A user study shows that the concepts identified by our model align with the concepts used by pathologists, making it a promising strategy for human-interpretable WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches: one is for generating bag-level features by prototype-guided aggregation of instance features, while the other is for enhancing class features through a combination of class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss.

| **[Promptable Representation Distribution Learning and Data Augmentation for Gigapixel Histopathology WSI Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14473v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gigapixel image analysis, particularly for whole slide images (WSIs), often relies on multiple instance learning (MIL). Under the paradigm of MIL, patch image representations are extracted and then fixed during the training of the MIL classifiers for efficiency consideration. However, the invariance of representations makes it difficult to perform data augmentation for WSI-level model training, which significantly limits the performance of the downstream WSI analysis. The current data augmentation methods for gigapixel images either introduce additional computational costs or result in a loss of semantic information, which is hard to meet the requirements for efficiency and stability needed for WSI model training. In this paper, we propose a Promptable Representation Distribution Learning framework (PRDL) for both patch-level representation learning and WSI-level data augmentation. Meanwhile, we explore the use of prompts to guide data augmentation in feature space, which achieves promptable data augmentation for training robust WSI-level models. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method stably outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Unsupervised Foundation Model-Agnostic Slide-Level Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13623v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning of pathology whole-slide images(WSIs) has primarily relied on weak supervision with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). This approach leads to slide representations highly tailored to a specific clinical task. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.5% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors. Code available at https://github.com/KatherLab/COBRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[MonoBox: Tightness-free Box-supervised Polyp Segmentation using Monotonicity Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01188v5)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MonoBox, an innovative box-supervised segmentation method constrained by monotonicity to liberate its training from the user-unfriendly box-tightness assumption. In contrast to conventional box-supervised segmentation, where the box edges must precisely touch the target boundaries, MonoBox leverages imprecisely-annotated boxes to achieve robust pixel-wise segmentation. The 'linchpin' is that, within the noisy zones around box edges, MonoBox discards the traditional misguiding multiple-instance learning loss, and instead optimizes a carefully-designed objective, termed monotonicity constraint. Along directions transitioning from the foreground to background, this new constraint steers responses to adhere to a trend of monotonically decreasing values. Consequently, the originally unreliable learning within the noisy zones is transformed into a correct and effective monotonicity optimization. Moreover, an adaptive label correction is introduced, enabling MonoBox to enhance the tightness of box annotations using predicted masks from the previous epoch and dynamically shrink the noisy zones as training progresses. We verify MonoBox in the box-supervised segmentation task of polyps, where satisfying box-tightness is challenging due to the vague boundaries between the polyp and normal tissues. Experiments on both public synthetic and in-house real noisy datasets demonstrate that MonoBox exceeds other anti-noise state-of-the-arts by improving Dice by at least 5.5% and 3.3%, respectively.

| **[Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block Dual Fusion of Whole Slide Images and Omics Data for Precision Oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17418v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of DNA methylation data with a Whole Slide Image (WSI) offers significant potential for enhancing the diagnostic precision of central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification in neuropathology. While existing approaches typically integrate encoded omic data with histology at either an early or late fusion stage, the potential of reintroducing omic data through dual fusion remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose the use of omic embeddings during early and late fusion to capture complementary information from local (patch-level) to global (slide-level) interactions, boosting performance through multimodal integration. In the early fusion stage, omic embeddings are projected onto WSI patches in latent-space, which generates embeddings that encapsulate per-patch molecular and morphological insights. This effectively incorporates omic information into the spatial representation of the WSI. These embeddings are then refined with a Multiple Instance Learning gated attention mechanism which attends to diagnostic patches. In the late fusion stage, we reintroduce the omic data by fusing it with slide-level omic-WSI embeddings using a Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB), which richly intermingles features from both modalities, capturing their correlations and complementarity. We demonstrate accurate CNS tumor subtyping across 20 fine-grained subtypes and validate our approach on benchmark datasets, achieving improved survival prediction on TCGA-BLCA and competitive performance on TCGA-BRCA compared to state-of-the-art methods. This dual fusion strategy enhances interpretability and classification performance, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised to 10 pages, with corrected typos, updated references (some added, others removed), improved figure quality, modified text for better method validation, added one more co-author, and identified the IEEE member</p></details> |
| **[Tiny Object Detection with Single Point Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05837v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tiny objects, with their limited spatial resolution, often resemble point-like distributions. As a result, bounding box prediction using point-level supervision emerges as a natural and cost-effective alternative to traditional box-level supervision. However, the small scale and lack of distinctive features of tiny objects make point annotations prone to noise, posing significant hurdles for model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose Point Teacher--the first end-to-end point-supervised method for robust tiny object detection in aerial images. To handle label noise from scale ambiguity and location shifts in point annotations, Point Teacher employs the teacher-student architecture and decouples the learning into a two-phase denoising process. In this framework, the teacher network progressively denoises the pseudo boxes derived from noisy point annotations, guiding the student network's learning. Specifically, in the first phase, random masking of image regions facilitates regression learning, enabling the teacher to transform noisy point annotations into coarse pseudo boxes. In the second phase, these coarse pseudo boxes are refined using dynamic multiple instance learning, which adaptively selects the most reliable instance from dynamically constructed proposal bags around the coarse pseudo boxes. Extensive experiments on three tiny object datasets (i.e., AI-TOD-v2, SODA-A, and TinyPerson) validate the proposed method's effectiveness and robustness against point location shifts. Notably, relying solely on point supervision, our Point Teacher already shows comparable performance with box-supervised learning methods. Codes and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, deploying an ensemble of digital pathology foundation models yields higher baseline accuracy, although the benefits appear to diminish with more complex MIL architectures.

Since differentiation of cancer sub-types is important for treatment and current, manual methods are time consuming and subjective, automatic computer-aided differentiation of cancer types is crucial. Manual differentiation of thyroid cancer is based on tissue sections, analysed by pathologists using histological features. Due to the enormous size of gigapixel whole slide images, holistic classification using deep learning methods is not feasible. Patch based multiple instance learning approaches, combined with aggregations such as bag-of-words, is a common approach. This work's contribution is to extend a patch based state-of-the-art method by generating and combining feature vectors of three different patch resolutions and analysing three distinct ways of combining them. The results showed improvements in one of the three multi-scale approaches, while the others led to decreased scores. This provides motivation for analysis and discussion of the individual approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IPTA 2022 (Best Paper) edit: During work on this publication Maximilian Ernst Tschuchnig was affiliated with Salzburg University of Applied Sciences and University of Salzburg</p></details> |
| **[Aligning Knowledge Concepts to Whole Slide Images for Precise Histopathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18101v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the large size and lack of fine-grained annotation, Whole Slide Images (WSIs) analysis is commonly approached as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, previous studies only learn from training data, posing a stark contrast to how human clinicians teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities and factors. Here we present a novel knowledge concept-based MIL framework, named ConcepPath to fill this gap. Specifically, ConcepPath utilizes GPT-4 to induce reliable diseasespecific human expert concepts from medical literature, and incorporate them with a group of purely learnable concepts to extract complementary knowledge from training data. In ConcepPath, WSIs are aligned to these linguistic knowledge concepts by utilizing pathology vision-language model as the basic building component. In the application of lung cancer subtyping, breast cancer HER2 scoring, and gastric cancer immunotherapy-sensitive subtyping task, ConcepPath significantly outperformed previous SOTA methods which lack the guidance of human expert knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZoomLDM: Latent Diffusion Model for multi-scale image generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16969v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, yet several challenges restrict their application to large-image domains, such as digital pathology and satellite imagery. Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales, excelling particularly in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to $4096 \times 4096$ pixels and $4\times$ super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments. We provide high-resolution examples of the generated images on our website https://histodiffusion.github.io/docs/publications/zoomldm/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ordinal Multiple-instance Learning for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Estimation with Selective Aggregated Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14750v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patient-level diagnosis of severity in ulcerative colitis (UC) is common in real clinical settings, where the most severe score in a patient is recorded. However, previous UC classification methods (i.e., image-level estimation) mainly assumed the input was a single image. Thus, these methods can not utilize severity labels recorded in real clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a patient-level severity estimation method by a transformer with selective aggregator tokens, where a severity label is estimated from multiple images taken from a patient, similar to a clinical setting. Our method can effectively aggregate features of severe parts from a set of images captured in each patient, and it facilitates improving the discriminative ability between adjacent severity classes. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two datasets compared with the state-of-the-art MIL methods. Moreover, we evaluated our method in real clinical settings and confirmed that our method outperformed the previous image-level methods.

| **[NACNet: A Histology Context-aware Transformer Graph Convolution Network for Predicting Treatment Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09766v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (Nov 07 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Partial Scene Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10261v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of partial scene text retrieval involves localizing and searching for text instances that are the same or similar to a given query text from an image gallery. However, existing methods can only handle text-line instances, leaving the problem of searching for partial patches within these text-line instances unsolved due to a lack of patch annotations in the training data. To address this issue, we propose a network that can simultaneously retrieve both text-line instances and their partial patches. Our method embeds the two types of data (query text and scene text instances) into a shared feature space and measures their cross-modal similarities. To handle partial patches, our proposed approach adopts a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach to learn their similarities with query text, without requiring extra annotations. However, constructing bags, which is a standard step of conventional MIL approaches, can introduce numerous noisy samples for training, and lower inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a Ranking MIL (RankMIL) approach to adaptively filter those noisy samples. Additionally, we present a Dynamic Partial Match Algorithm (DPMA) that can directly search for the target partial patch from a text-line instance during the inference stage, without requiring bags. This greatly improves the search efficiency and the performance of retrieving partial patches.

This development enables comprehensive digital reviews by pathologists and accelerates AI-driven diagnostic support for WSI analysis. Recent advances in foundational pathology models have increased the need for benchmarking tasks. The Camelyon series is one of the most widely used open-source datasets in computational pathology. However, the quality, accessibility, and clinical relevance of the labels have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs and labels from the Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17 datasets, removing low-quality slides, correcting erroneous labels, and providing expert pixel annotations for tumor regions in the previously unreleased test set. Based on the sizes of re-annotated tumor regions, we upgraded the binary cancer screening task to a four-class task: negative, micro-metastasis, macro-metastasis, and Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC). We reevaluated pre-trained pathology feature extractors and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods using the cleaned dataset, providing a benchmark that advances AI development in histopathology.</p></details> |  |

While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies. It can be used alone or combined with any mechanism to model global dependencies (e.g., transformers). A thorough empirical validation shows that our module leads to state-of-the-art performance in localization while being competitive or superior in classification.

This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of anomaly detection through the application of Two-Stream Inflated 3D (I3D) Convolutional Networks. These networks substantially outperform traditional 3D Convolutional Networks (C3D) by more effectively extracting spatial and temporal features from surveillance videos, thus improving the precision of anomaly detection. Our research advances the field by implementing a weakly supervised learning framework based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uniquely conceptualizes surveillance videos as collections of 'bags' that contain instances (video clips). Each instance is innovatively processed through a ranking mechanism that prioritizes clips based on their potential to display anomalies. This novel strategy not only enhances the accuracy and precision of anomaly detection but also significantly diminishes the dependency on extensive manual annotations. Moreover, through meticulous optimization of model settings, including the choice of optimizer, our approach not only establishes new benchmarks in the performance of anomaly detection systems but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world surveillance applications. This paper contributes significantly to the field of computer vision by delivering a more adaptable, efficient, and context-aware anomaly detection system, which is poised to redefine practices in urban surveillance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we introduce a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.13725</p></details> |

There is promising potential in utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) to automate the differentiation of CRC subtypes by analyzing Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). Due to the extensive size of WSIs, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques are typically explored. However, existing MIL methods focus on identifying the most representative image patches for classification, which may result in the loss of critical information. Additionally, these methods often overlook clinically relevant information, like the tendency for MSI class tumors to predominantly occur on the proximal (right side) colon. We introduce `CIMIL-CRC', a DNN framework that: 1) solves the MSI/MSS MIL problem by efficiently combining a pre-trained feature extraction model with principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate information from all patches, and 2) integrates clinical priors, particularly the tumor location within the colon, into the model to enhance patient-level classification accuracy. We assessed our CIMIL-CRC method using the average area under the curve (AUC) from a 5-fold cross-validation experimental setup for model development on the TCGA-CRC-DX cohort, contrasting it with a baseline patch-level classification, MIL-only approach, and Clinically-informed patch-level classification approach. Our CIMIL-CRC outperformed all methods (AUROC: $0.92\pm0.002$ (95\% CI 0.91-0.92), vs. $0.79\pm0.02$ (95\% CI 0.76-0.82), $0.86\pm0.01$ (95\% CI 0.85-0.88), and $0.87\pm0.01$ (95\% CI 0.86-0.88), respectively).

| **[Weak to Strong Learning from Aggregate Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06200v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In learning from aggregate labels, the training data consists of sets or "bags" of feature-vectors (instances) along with an aggregate label for each bag derived from the (usually {0,1}-valued) labels of its instances. In learning from label proportions (LLP), the aggregate label is the average of the bag's instance labels, whereas in multiple instance learning (MIL) it is the OR. The goal is to train an instance-level predictor, typically achieved by fitting a model on the training data, in particular one that maximizes the accuracy which is the fraction of satisfied bags i.e., those on which the predicted labels are consistent with the aggregate label. A weak learner has at a constant accuracy < 1 on the training bags, while a strong learner's accuracy can be arbitrarily close to 1. We study the problem of using a weak learner on such training bags with aggregate labels to obtain a strong learner, analogous to supervised learning for which boosting algorithms are known. Our first result shows the impossibility of boosting in LLP using weak classifiers of any accuracy < 1 by constructing a collection of bags for which such weak learners (for any weight assignment) exist, while not admitting any strong learner. A variant of this construction also rules out boosting in MIL for a non-trivial range of weak learner accuracy. In the LLP setting however, we show that a weak learner (with small accuracy) on large enough bags can in fact be used to obtain a strong learner for small bags, in polynomial time. We also provide more efficient, sampling based variant of our procedure with probabilistic guarantees which are empirically validated on three real and two synthetic datasets. Our work is the first to theoretically study weak to strong learning from aggregate labels, with an algorithm to achieve the same for LLP, while proving the impossibility of boosting for both LLP and MIL.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, developing such scoring models requires large pixel-level annotated datasets. Transfer learning allows prior knowledge from different datasets to be reused while multiple-instance learning (MIL) allows the lack of detailed annotations to be mitigated. The aim of this work is to examine the potential of transfer learning on the performance of deep learning models pre-trained on (i) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, (ii) H\&E images and (iii) non-medical images. A MIL framework with an attention mechanism is developed using pre-trained models as patch-embedding models. It was found that embedding models pre-trained on H\&E images consistently outperformed the others, resulting in an average AUC-ROC value of $0.622$ across the 4 HER2 scores ($0.59-0.80$ per HER2 score). Furthermore, it was found that using multiple-instance learning with an attention layer not only allows for good classification results to be achieved, but it can also help with producing visual indication of HER2-positive areas in the H\&E slide image by utilising the patch-wise attention weights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |

Inflammatory processes in the placenta have short-term, and long-term consequences for offspring health. Digital pathology and machine learning can play an important role in understanding placental inflammation, and there have been very few investigations into methods for predicting and understanding Maternal Inflammatory Response (MIR). This work intends to investigate the potential of using machine learning to understand MIR based on whole slide images (WSI), and establish early benchmarks. To that end, we use Multiple Instance Learning framework with 3 feature extractors: ImageNet-based EfficientNet-v2s, and 2 histopathology foundation models, UNI and Phikon to investigate predictability of MIR stage from histopathology WSIs. We also interpret predictions from these models using the learned attention maps from these models. We also use the MIL framework for predicting white blood cells count (WBC) and maximum fever temperature ($T_{max}$). Attention-based MIL models are able to classify MIR with a balanced accuracy of up to 88.5% with a Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa$) of up to 0.772. Furthermore, we found that the pathology foundation models (UNI and Phikon) are both able to achieve higher performance with balanced accuracy and $\kappa$, compared to ImageNet-based feature extractor (EfficientNet-v2s). For WBC and $T_{max}$ prediction, we found mild correlation between actual values and those predicted from histopathology WSIs. We used MIL framework for predicting MIR stage from WSIs, and compared effectiveness of foundation models as feature extractors, with that of an ImageNet-based model. We further investigated model failure cases and found them to be either edge cases prone to interobserver variability, examples of pathologist's overreach, or mislabeled due to processing errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[MamMIL: Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images with State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05160v3)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pathological diagnosis has achieved superior performance by combining deep learning models with the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework using whole slide images (WSIs). However, the giga-pixeled nature of WSIs poses a great challenge for efficient MIL. Existing studies either do not consider global dependencies among instances, or use approximations such as linear attentions to model the pair-to-pair instance interactions, which inevitably brings performance bottlenecks. To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework named MamMIL for WSI analysis by cooperating the selective structured state space model (i.e., Mamba) with MIL, enabling the modeling of global instance dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. Specifically, considering the irregularity of the tissue regions in WSIs, we represent each WSI as an undirected graph. To address the problem that Mamba can only process 1D sequences, we further propose a topology-aware scanning mechanism to serialize the WSI graphs while preserving the topological relationships among the instances. Finally, in order to further perceive the topological structures among the instances and incorporate short-range feature interactions, we propose an instance aggregation block based on graph neural networks. Experiments show that MamMIL can achieve advanced performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks.

We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks.

| **[SCMIL: Sparse Context-aware Multiple Instance Learning for Predicting Cancer Survival Probability Distribution in Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00664v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer survival prediction is a challenging task that involves analyzing of the tumor microenvironment within Whole Slide Image (WSI). Previous methods cannot effectively capture the intricate interaction features among instances within the local area of WSI. Moreover, existing methods for cancer survival prediction based on WSI often fail to provide better clinically meaningful predictions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Sparse Context-aware Multiple Instance Learning (SCMIL) framework for predicting cancer survival probability distributions. SCMIL innovatively segments patches into various clusters based on their morphological features and spatial location information, subsequently leveraging sparse self-attention to discern the relationships between these patches with a context-aware perspective. Considering many patches are irrelevant to the task, we introduce a learnable patch filtering module called SoftFilter, which ensures that only interactions between task-relevant patches are considered. To enhance the clinical relevance of our prediction, we propose a register-based mixture density network to forecast the survival probability distribution for individual patients. We evaluate SCMIL on two public WSI datasets from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) specifically focusing on lung adenocarcinom (LUAD) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Our experimental results indicate that SCMIL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for survival prediction, offering more clinically meaningful and interpretable outcomes.

However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework. Results demonstrate the ability of foundation models to surpass ImageNet-pretrained models for the prediction of six skin cancer subtypes</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted for oral presentation at Decision Science Allieance -INternational Summer Conference (DSA-ISC) 2024 held on Valencia, Spain</p></details> |
| **[Slide-based Graph Collaborative Training for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10260v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of computational pathology lies in the consensus that pathological characteristics of tumors are significant guidance for cancer diagnostics. Most existing research focuses on the inner-contextual information within each WSI yet ignores the possible inter-correlations between slides. As the development of tumors is a continuous process involving a series of histological, morphological, and genetic changes that accumulate over time, the similarities and differences between WSIs across various stages, grades, locations and patients should potentially contribute to the representation of WSIs and deserve to be taken into account in WSI modeling. To verify the advancement of introducing the slide inter-correlations into the representation learning of WSIs, we proposed a generic WSI analysis pipeline SlideGCD that can be adapted to any existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks and improve their performance. With the new paradigm, the prior knowledge of cancer development can participate in the end-to-end workflow, which concurrently initializes and refines the slide representation, as a guide for message passing in the slide-based graph. Extensive comparisons and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed pipeline across 4 different tasks, including cancer subtyping, cancer staging, survival prediction, and gene mutation prediction, with 7 representative SOTA WSI analysis frameworks as backbones.</p></details> |  |

However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\%, 95.9\%, and 88.1\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CAMIL enhances model interpretability by identifying regions of high diagnostic value.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

However, current methods fall short in bridging the domain gap between pretrained models and medical imaging, and often fail to account for spatial relationships across different magnifications. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Concentric Dual Fusion Attention-MIL (CDFA-MIL) framework,which innovatively combines point-to-area feature-colum attention and point-to-point concentric-row attention using concentric patch. This approach is designed to effectively fuse correlated information, enhancing feature representation and providing stronger correlation guidance for WSI analysis. CDFA-MIL distinguishes itself by offering a robust fusion strategy that leads to superior WSI recognition. Its application has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly surpassing existing MIL methods in accuracy and F1 scores on prominent datasets like Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Specifically, CDFA-MIL achieved an average accuracy and F1-score of 93.7\% and 94.1\% respectively on these datasets, marking a notable advancement over traditional MIL approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need for additional experiments</p></details> |

A WSI, acquired at gigapixel size, is commonly tiled into patches and processed by multiple-instance learning (MIL) models. Previous MIL-based models designed for this problem have only been evaluated on individual tasks for specific organs, and the ability to handle multiple tasks within a single model has not been investigated. In this study, we propose MECFormer, a generative Transformer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks within one model. To leverage the power of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and to enhance the model's effectiveness in focusing on each individual task, we introduce an Expert Consultation Network, a projection layer placed at the beginning of the Transformer-based model. Additionally, to enable flexible classification, autoregressive decoding is incorporated by a language decoder for WSI classification. Through extensive experiments on five datasets involving four different organs, one cancer classification task, and four cancer subtyping tasks, MECFormer demonstrates superior performance compared to individual state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ACCV2024</p></details> |

State-of-the-art methods use self-supervised patch-wise feature representations for multiple instance learning (MIL). Recently, methods have been proposed to fine-tune the feature representation on the downstream task using pseudo labeling, but mostly focusing on selecting high-quality positive patches. In this paper, we propose to mine hard negative samples during fine-tuning. This allows us to obtain better feature representations and reduce the training cost. Furthermore, we propose a novel patch-wise ranking loss in MIL to better exploit these hard negative samples. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of these proposed ideas.

We address this limitation by applying attention multiple instance learning (AMIL) to US images. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 333 patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules at UCLA medical center (259 benign, 74 malignant). A multi-modal deep learning AMIL model was developed, combining US images and MT to classify the nodules as benign or malignant and enhance the malignancy risk stratification of MT. Results: The final AMIL model matched MT sensitivity (0.946) while significantly improving PPV (0.477 vs 0.448 for MT alone), indicating fewer false positives while maintaining high sensitivity. Conclusion: Our approach reduces false positives compared to MT while maintaining the same ability to identify positive cases, potentially reducing unnecessary benign thyroid resections in patients with indeterminate nodules.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Dual Graph Attention based Disentanglement Multiple Instance Learning for Brain Age Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01246v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning techniques have demonstrated great potential for accurately estimating brain age by analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from healthy individuals. However, current methods for brain age estimation often directly utilize whole input images, overlooking two important considerations: 1) the heterogeneous nature of brain aging, where different brain regions may degenerate at different rates, and 2) the existence of age-independent redundancies in brain structure. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Dual Graph Attention based Disentanglement Multi-instance Learning (DGA-DMIL) framework for improving brain age estimation. Specifically, the 3D MRI data, treated as a bag of instances, is fed into a 2D convolutional neural network backbone, to capture the unique aging patterns in MRI. A dual graph attention aggregator is then proposed to learn the backbone features by exploiting the intra- and inter-instance relationships. Furthermore, a disentanglement branch is introduced to separate age-related features from age-independent structural representations to ameliorate the interference of redundant information on age prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we evaluate it on two datasets, UK Biobank and ADNI, containing a total of 35,388 healthy individuals. Our proposed model demonstrates exceptional accuracy in estimating brain age, achieving a remarkable mean absolute error of 2.12 years in the UK Biobank. The results establish our approach as state-of-the-art compared to other competing brain age estimation models. In addition, the instance contribution scores identify the varied importance of brain areas for aging prediction, which provides deeper insights into the understanding of brain aging.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Agent Aggregator with Mask Denoise Mechanism for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11664v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology analysis is the gold standard for medical diagnosis. Accurate classification of whole slide images (WSIs) and region-of-interests (ROIs) localization can assist pathologists in diagnosis. The gigapixel resolution of WSI and the absence of fine-grained annotations make direct classification and analysis challenging. In weakly supervised learning, multiple instance learning (MIL) presents a promising approach for WSI classification. The prevailing strategy is to use attention mechanisms to measure instance importance for classification. However, attention mechanisms fail to capture inter-instance information, and self-attention causes quadratic computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose AMD-MIL, an agent aggregator with a mask denoise mechanism. The agent token acts as an intermediate variable between the query and key for computing instance importance. Mask and denoising matrices, mapped from agents-aggregated value, dynamically mask low-contribution representations and eliminate noise. AMD-MIL achieves better attention allocation by adjusting feature representations, capturing micro-metastases in cancer, and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, CAMELYON-17, TCGA-KIDNEY, and TCGA-LUNG show AMD-MIL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantitative Evaluation of MILs' Reliability For WSIs Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11110v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable models are dependable and provide predictions acceptable given basic domain knowledge. Therefore, it is critical to develop and deploy reliable models, especially for healthcare applications. However, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models designed for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) classification in computational pathology are not evaluated in terms of reliability. Hence, in this paper we compare the reliability of MIL models with three suggested metrics and use three region-wise annotated datasets. We find the mean pooling instance (MEAN-POOL-INS) model more reliable than other networks despite its naive architecture design and computation efficiency. The code to reproduce the results is accessible at https://github.com/tueimage/MILs'R .</p></details> |  |
| **[Digital Volumetric Biopsy Cores Improve Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer Using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08331v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) was the most frequently diagnosed cancer among American men in 2023. The histological grading of biopsies is essential for diagnosis, and various deep learning-based solutions have been developed to assist with this task. Existing deep learning frameworks are typically applied to individual 2D cross-sections sliced from 3D biopsy tissue specimens. This process impedes the analysis of complex tissue structures such as glands, which can vary depending on the tissue slice examined. We propose a novel digital pathology data source called a "volumetric core," obtained via the extraction and co-alignment of serially sectioned tissue sections using a novel morphology-preserving alignment framework. We trained an attention-based multiple-instance learning (ABMIL) framework on deep features extracted from volumetric patches to automatically classify the Gleason Grade Group (GGG). To handle volumetric patches, we used a modified video transformer with a deep feature extractor pretrained using self-supervised learning. We ran our morphology-preserving alignment framework to construct 10,210 volumetric cores, leaving out 30% for pretraining. The rest of the dataset was used to train ABMIL, which resulted in a 0.958 macro-average AUC, 0.671 F1 score, 0.661 precision, and 0.695 recall averaged across all five GGG significantly outperforming the 2D baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show great promise across many tasks, but analyses have typically been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task. We report the most rigorous single-task validation of histopathology foundation models to date, specifically in ovarian cancer morphological subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using three ImageNet-pretrained feature extractors and fourteen histopathology foundation models. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for hold-out testing and external validation on the Transcanadian Study and OCEAN Challenge datasets. The best-performing model used the H-optimus-0 foundation model, with five-class balanced accuracies of 89%, 97%, and 74% in the test sets. Normalisations and augmentations aided the performance of the ImageNet-pretrained ResNets, but these were still outperformed by 13 of the 14 foundation models. Hyperparameter tuning the downstream classifiers improved performance by a median 1.9% balanced accuracy, with many improvements being statistically significant. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to ovarian cancer subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion to histopathologists diagnosing challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shapley Values-enabled Progressive Pseudo Bag Augmentation for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05490v4)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, whole-slide image (WSI) classification presents a formidable challenge due to its gigapixel resolution and limited fine-grained annotations. Multiple-instance learning (MIL) offers a weakly supervised solution, yet refining instance-level information from bag-level labels remains challenging. While most of the conventional MIL methods use attention scores to estimate instance importance scores (IIS) which contribute to the prediction of the slide labels, these often lead to skewed attention distributions and inaccuracies in identifying crucial instances. To address these issues, we propose a new approach inspired by cooperative game theory: employing Shapley values to assess each instance's contribution, thereby improving IIS estimation. The computation of the Shapley value is then accelerated using attention, meanwhile retaining the enhanced instance identification and prioritization. We further introduce a framework for the progressive assignment of pseudo bags based on estimated IIS, encouraging more balanced attention distributions in MIL models. Our extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, BRACS, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRCA datasets show our method's superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering enhanced interpretability and class-wise insights.

The Fuzzy Integral (FI), in particular, the Choquet integral (ChI), is often used as a powerful nonlinear aggregator for fusion across multiple sensors. However, existing supervised ChI learning algorithms typically require precise training labels for each input data point, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Additionally, prior work on ChI fusion is often based only on the normalized fuzzy measures, which bounds the fuzzy measure values between [0, 1]. This can be limiting in cases where the underlying scales of input data sources are bipolar (i.e., between [-1, 1]). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Choquet integral-based fusion framework, named Bi-MIChI (pronounced "bi-mi-kee"), which uses bi-capacities to represent the interactions between pairs of subsets of the input sensor sources on a bi-polar scale. This allows for extended non-linear interactions between the sensor sources and can lead to interesting fusion results. Bi-MIChI also addresses label uncertainty through Multiple Instance Learning, where training labels are applied to "bags" (sets) of data instead of per-instance. Our proposed Bi-MIChI framework shows effective classification and detection performance on both synthetic and real-world experiments for sensor fusion with label uncertainty. We also provide detailed analyses on the behavior of the fuzzy measures to demonstrate our fusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables; Accepted to 2024 FUZZ-IEEE and presented at 2024 IEEE WCCI; Code available at https://github.com/hvak/Bi-MIChI</p></details> |
| **[CanvOI, an Oncology Intelligence Foundation Model: Scaling FLOPS Differently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02885v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly evolving field of digital oncopathology faces significant challenges, including the need to address diverse and complex clinical questions, often involving rare conditions, with limited availability of labeled data. These limitations hinder the development of robust AI-driven tools in the biomedical space, where accuracy in probabilistic determinations is of utmost importance. To address this, digital pathology foundation models have begun to emerge, typically developed with the size and diversity of the pre-training dataset and model parameters in mind. Here, we present CanvOI, a ViT-g/10-based foundation model designed to enhance the capabilities of digital pathology by addressing these challenges through a different approach. Considering the unique nature of oncologic histopathological images and the requirements from the embeddings to provide meaningful representations for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) downstream models, we chose to modify the input image characteristics. By introducing larger tile sizes (380 x 380 pixels) and smaller patch sizes (10 x 10 pixels), we were able to optimize the model's performance, pushing computational resources in a new direction and achieving state-of-the-art performance on cancer-related benchmarks. CanvOI demonstrated a 1.5-7.4% improvement in averaged AUC compared to other leading foundation models built for digital pathology. Moreover, our results demonstrate that CanvOI significantly outperformed the other models, with the performance gap widening substantially when trained on just 10% of the initial cohort. This work highlights an alternative approach that, if integrated with traditional development approaches, has the potential to advance Oncology Intelligence (OI), overcome some of the current barriers and ultimately improve the clinical outcome of cancer patients.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

The first (``thinking fast'') stage finds the most relevant WSI area for biochemical recurrence and the second (``thinking slow'') stage leverages higher resolution patches to predict TTR. Our approach reveals a mean C-index ($Ci$) of 0.733 ($\theta=0.059$) on our internal validation and $Ci=0.603$ on the LEOPARD challenge validation set.

However, the ambiguous nature of anomaly definitions across contexts may introduce inaccuracy in discriminating abnormal and normal events. To show the model what is anomalous, a novel framework is proposed to guide the learning of suspected anomalies from event prompts. Given a textual prompt dictionary of potential anomaly events and the captions generated from anomaly videos, the semantic anomaly similarity between them could be calculated to identify the suspected events for each video snippet. It enables a new multi-prompt learning process to constrain the visual-semantic features across all videos, as well as provides a new way to label pseudo anomalies for self-training. To demonstrate its effectiveness, comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies are conducted on four datasets, namely XD-Violence, UCF-Crime, TAD, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in terms of AP or AUC (86.5\%, \hl{90.4}\%, 94.4\%, and 97.4\%). Furthermore, it shows promising performance in open-set and cross-dataset cases. The data, code, and models can be found at: \url{https://github.com/shiwoaz/lap}.</p></details> |  |

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention-mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and AMBIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.86$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.53$\pm$0.05, for tumor category, family and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for identifying tooth-marked tongues are subjective and inconsistent because they rely on practitioner experience. We propose a novel fully automated Weakly Supervised method using Vision transformer and Multiple instance learning WSVM for tongue extraction and tooth-marked tongue recognition. Our approach first accurately detects and extracts the tongue region from clinical images, removing any irrelevant background information. Then, we implement an end-to-end weakly supervised object detection method. We utilize Vision Transformer (ViT) to process tongue images in patches and employ multiple instance loss to identify tooth-marked regions with only image-level annotations. WSVM achieves high accuracy in tooth-marked tongue classification, and visualization experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing these regions.

DexBERT, a pre-trained BERT-like model tailored for Android representation learning, enriches class-level representations by analyzing Smali code extracted from APKs. However, its functionality is constrained by its inability to process multiple Smali classes simultaneously. This paper introduces DetectBERT, which integrates correlated Multiple Instance Learning (c-MIL) with DexBERT to handle the high dimensionality and variability of Android malware, enabling effective app-level detection. By treating class-level features as instances within MIL bags, DetectBERT aggregates these into a comprehensive app-level representation. Our evaluation demonstrates that DetectBERT not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art detection methods but also adapts to evolving malware threats. Moreover, the versatility of the DetectBERT framework holds promising potential for broader applications in app-level analysis and other software engineering tasks, offering new avenues for research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ESEM 2024</p></details> |

Despite the progress made, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a promising paradigm within CPath, continues to face challenges, particularly related to incomplete information utilization. Existing frameworks, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), attention, and selective scan space state sequential model (SSM), lack sufficient flexibility and scalability in fusing diverse features, and cannot effectively fuse diverse features. Additionally, current approaches do not adequately exploit order-related and order-independent features, resulting in suboptimal utilization of sequence information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MIL framework called Mamba2MIL. Our framework utilizes the state space duality model (SSD) to model long sequences of patches of whole slide images (WSIs), which, combined with weighted feature selection, supports the fusion processing of more branching features and can be extended according to specific application needs. Moreover, we introduce a sequence transformation method tailored to varying WSI sizes, which enhances sequence-independent features while preserving local sequence information, thereby improving sequence information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mamba2MIL surpasses state-of-the-art MIL methods. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets, achieving improvements in nearly all performance metrics. Specifically, on the NSCLC dataset, Mamba2MIL achieves a binary tumor classification AUC of 0.9533 and an accuracy of 0.8794. On the BRACS dataset, it achieves a multiclass classification AUC of 0.7986 and an accuracy of 0.4981. The code is available at https://github.com/YuqiZhang-Buaa/Mamba2MIL.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the tremendous amount of surveillance videos, most of the available data for the task is unlabeled or semi-labeled with the video class known, but the location of the anomaly event is unknown. In this work, we target anomaly localization in semi-supervised videos. While the mainstream direction in addressing this task is focused on segment-level multi-instance learning and the generation of pseudo labels, we aim to explore a promising yet unfulfilled direction to solve the problem by learning the temporal relations within videos in order to locate anomaly events. To this end, we propose a hierarchical transformer model designed to evaluate the significance of observed actions in anomalous videos with a divide-and-conquer strategy along the temporal axis. Our approach segments a parent video hierarchically into multiple temporal children instances and measures the influence of the children nodes in classifying the abnormality of the parent video. Evaluating our model on two well-known anomaly detection datasets, UCF-crime and ShanghaiTech, proves its ability to interpret the observed actions within videos and localize the anomalous ones. Our proposed approach outperforms previous works relying on segment-level multiple-instance learning approaches while reaching a promising performance compared to the more recent pseudo-labeling-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR-2024)</p></details> |

However, the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of manual annotations present substantial challenges. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising weakly supervised learning approach for WSI classification. Recently research revealed employing pseudo bag augmentation can encourage models to learn various data, thus bolstering models' performance. While directly inheriting the parents' labels can introduce more noise by mislabeling in training. To address this issue, we translate the WSI classification task from weakly supervised learning to semi-weakly supervised learning, termed SWS-MIL, where adaptive pseudo bag augmentation (AdaPse) is employed to assign labeled and unlabeled data based on a threshold strategy. Using the "student-teacher" pattern, we introduce a feature augmentation technique, MergeUp, which merges bags with low-priority bags to enhance inter-category information, increasing training data diversity. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16, BRACS, and TCGA-LUNG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches, affirming its efficacy in WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

Diseases like Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) pose challenges due to scarce and costly annotations on a single-cell level. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) addresses weakly labeled scenarios but necessitates powerful encoders typically trained with labeled data. In this study, we explore Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as a pre-training approach for MIL-based AML subtype classification from blood smears, removing the need for labeled data during encoder training. We investigate the three state-of-the-art SSL methods SimCLR, SwAV, and DINO, and compare their performance against supervised pre-training. Our findings show that SSL-pretrained encoders achieve comparable performance, showcasing the potential of SSL in MIL. This breakthrough offers a cost-effective and data-efficient solution, propelling the field of AI-based disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, this paradigm relies on the use of a large number of labelled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases present significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with the pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI classification (FSWC) tasks. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC tasks. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multi-scale, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to get the WSI-level features. Based on two VLMs, extensive experiments and visualizations on three datasets demonstrated the powerful performance of our MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5tables</p></details> |

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and methodologies associated with applying MIL to WSI analysis, including attention mechanisms, pseudo-labeling, transformers, pooling functions, and graph neural networks. Additionally, it explores the potential of MIL in discovering cancer cell morphology, constructing interpretable machine learning models, and quantifying cancer grading.

| **[AEM: Attention Entropy Maximization for Multiple Instance Learning based Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15303v2)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has demonstrated effectiveness in analyzing whole slide images (WSIs), yet it often encounters overfitting challenges in real-world applications, particularly in the form of attention over-concentration. While existing methods to alleviate this issue introduce complex modules or processing steps, such as multiple-stage training and teacher-student distillation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective regularization: Attention Entropy Maximization (AEM). Motivated by our investigation revealing a positive correlation between attention entropy and model performance, AEM incorporates a negative entropy loss for attention values into the standard MIL framework, penalizing overly concentrated attention and encouraging the model to consider a broader range of informative regions in WSIs, potentially improving its generalization capabilities. Compared to existing overfitting mitigation methods, our AEM approach offers advantages of simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. It requires no additional modules or processing steps, involves only one hyperparameter, and demonstrates compatibility with MIL frameworks and techniques. These advantages make AEM particularly attractive for practical applications. We evaluate AEM on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Furthermore, AEM shows high versatility, integrating effectively with four feature extractors, two advanced MIL frameworks, three attention mechanisms, and Subsampling augmentation technique.

| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning: Developing an Instance-Level Classifier via Weakly-Supervised Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04813v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) problem is currently solved from either bag-classification or instance-classification perspective, both of which ignore important information contained in some instances and result in limited performance. For example, existing methods often face difficulty in learning hard positive instances. In this paper, we formulate MIL as a semi-supervised instance classification problem, so that all the labeled and unlabeled instances can be fully utilized to train a better classifier. The difficulty in this formulation is that all the labeled instances are negative in MIL, and traditional self-training techniques used in semi-supervised learning tend to degenerate in generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled instances in this scenario. To resolve this problem, we propose a weakly-supervised self-training method, in which we utilize the positive bag labels to construct a global constraint and a local constraint on the pseudo labels to prevent them from degenerating and force the classifier to learn hard positive instances. It is worth noting that easy positive instances are instances are far from the decision boundary in the classification process, while hard positive instances are those close to the decision boundary. Through iterative optimization, the pseudo labels can gradually approach the true labels. Extensive experiments on two MNIST synthetic datasets, five traditional MIL benchmark datasets and two histopathology whole slide image datasets show that our method achieved new SOTA performance on all of them. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

First, we illustrate that learning temporal position-aware representations of discrete timesteps can greatly improve static visual multiple instance learning methods that do not regard temporality and concentrate almost exclusively on visual content analysis. We further demonstrate the significant advantages of end-to-end sequential multiple instance learning, integrating visual content and temporal information in a multimodal manner. As application we focus on fine art analysis related tasks. To that end, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer can leverage visual set and temporal position-aware representations for modelling visual artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success. Finally, through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank, and a visual learning-to-rank downstream task, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer captures essential temporal information improving the performance of strong static and sequential multiple instance learning methods for predicting artistic success.</p></details> |  |
| **[SC-MIL: Sparsely Coded Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00048v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely used in weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification. Typical MIL methods include a feature embedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained feature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into predictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This involves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training as well as modeling the correlations between instances separately. In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that addresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary learning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances by expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete dictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings by suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To make the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we unrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling. The proposed SC module can be incorporated into any existing MIL framework in a plug-and-play manner with an acceptable computational cost. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed SC module could substantially boost the performance of state-of-the-art MIL methods.

However, WSIs are costly, memory-intensive, and require extensive analysis time. As an alternative, microscopy-based analysis offers cost and memory efficiency, though microscopy images face issues with unknown absolute positions and redundant images due to multiple captures from the subjective perspectives of pathologists. To this end, we introduce MicroMIL, a weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically built to address these challenges by dynamically clustering images using deep cluster embedding (DCE) and Gumbel Softmax for representative image extraction. Graph edges are then constructed from the upper triangular similarity matrix, with nodes connected to their most similar neighbors, and a graph neural network (GNN) is utilized to capture local and diverse areas of contextual information. Unlike existing graph-based MIL methods designed for WSIs that require absolute positions, MicroMIL efficiently handles the graph edges without this need. Extensive evaluations on real-world colon cancer (Seegene) and public BreakHis datasets demonstrate that MicroMIL outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for patient diagnosis using microscopy images.

While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p < 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</p></details> |  |

Multi-resolution graph models leverage the spatial relationships of patches at multiple magnifications, learning the context for each patch. In this study, we conduct the most thorough validation of a graph model for ovarian cancer subtyping to date. Seven models were tuned and trained using five-fold cross-validation on a set of 1864 whole slide images (WSIs) from 434 patients treated at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. The cross-validation models were ensembled and evaluated using a balanced hold-out test set of 100 WSIs from 30 patients, and an external validation set of 80 WSIs from 80 patients in the Transcanadian Study. The best-performing model, a graph model using 10x+20x magnification data, gave balanced accuracies of 73%, 88%, and 99% in cross-validation, hold-out testing, and external validation, respectively. However, this only exceeded the performance of attention-based multiple instance learning in external validation, with a 93% balanced accuracy. Graph models benefitted greatly from using the UNI foundation model rather than an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet50 for feature extraction, with this having a much greater effect on performance than changing the subsequent classification approach. The accuracy of the combined foundation model and multi-resolution graph network offers a step towards the clinical applicability of these models, with a new highest-reported performance for this task, though further validations are still required to ensure the robustness and usability of the models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initially submitted version of a paper which has been accepted in the GRAIL workshop at MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor, such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks, limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue, we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) for re-embedding the instance features online, which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator, R$^2$T is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features, and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the R$^2$T can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) R$^2$T-MIL, as an R$^2$T-enhanced AB-MIL, outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/RRT-MIL.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

Current MIL models predominantly rely on instance-level features derived from pretrained models such as ResNet. These models segment each WSI into independent patches and extract features from these local patches, leading to a significant loss of global spatial context and restricting the model's focus to merely local features. To address this issue, we propose a novel MIL framework, named SAM-MIL, that emphasizes spatial contextual awareness and explicitly incorporates spatial context by extracting comprehensive, image-level information. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a pioneering visual segmentation foundational model that can capture segmentation features without the need for additional fine-tuning, rendering it an outstanding tool for extracting spatial context directly from raw WSIs. Our approach includes the design of group feature extraction based on spatial context and a SAM-Guided Group Masking strategy to mitigate class imbalance issues. We implement a dynamic mask ratio for different segmentation categories and supplement these with representative group features of categories. Moreover, SAM-MIL divides instances to generate additional pseudo-bags, thereby augmenting the training set, and introduces consistency of spatial context across pseudo-bags to further enhance the model's performance. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demonstrate that our proposed SAM-MIL model outperforms existing mainstream methods in WSIs classification.

However, existing MIL methods predominantly focus on single-task learning, resulting in not only overall low efficiency but also the overlook of inter-task relatedness. To address these issues, we proposed an adapted architecture of Multi-gate Mixture-of-experts with Multi-proxy for Multiple instance learning (M4), and applied this framework for simultaneous prediction of multiple genetic mutations from WSIs. The proposed M4 model has two main innovations: (1) utilizing a mixture of experts with multiple gating strategies for multi-genetic mutation prediction on a single pathological slide; (2) constructing multi-proxy expert network and gate network for comprehensive and effective modeling of pathological image information. Our model achieved significant improvements across five tested TCGA datasets in comparison to current state-of-the-art single-task methods.

However, aligning WSIs with diagnostic captions presents a significant challenge. This difficulty arises from two main factors: 1) Gigapixel WSIs are unsuitable for direct input into deep learning models, and the redundancy and correlation among the patches demand more attention; and 2) Authentic WSI diagnostic captions are extremely limited, making it difficult to train an effective model. To overcome these obstacles, we present PathM3, a multimodal, multi-task, multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for WSI classification and captioning. PathM3 adapts a query-based transformer to effectively align WSIs with diagnostic captions. Given that histopathology visual patterns are redundantly distributed across WSIs, we aggregate each patch feature with MIL method that considers the correlations among instances. Furthermore, our PathM3 overcomes data scarcity in WSI-level captions by leveraging limited WSI diagnostic caption data in the manner of multi-task joint learning. Extensive experiments with improved classification accuracy and caption generation demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both WSI classification and captioning task.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, this task is still challenging from a medical point of view due to the complexity of the interaction between the patient organism and the considered treatment. Recent works on foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning on large-scale unlabeled histopathology datasets have opened a new direction towards the development of new methods for cancer diagnosis related tasks. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for predicting Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients treatment response from Whole Slide Images. Our method exploits several foundation models as feature extractors to obtain a local representation of the image corresponding to a small region of the tissue, then, a global representation of the image is obtained by aggregating these local representations using attention-based Multiple Instance Learning. Our experimental study conducted on a dataset of 152 patients, shows the promising results of our methodology, notably by highlighting the advantage of using foundation models compared to conventional ImageNet pre-training.

| **[cDP-MIL: Robust Multiple Instance Learning via Cascaded Dirichlet Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11448v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been extensively applied to whole slide histopathology image (WSI) analysis. The existing aggregation strategy in MIL, which primarily relies on the first-order distance (e.g., mean difference) between instances, fails to accurately approximate the true feature distribution of each instance, leading to biased slide-level representations. Moreover, the scarcity of WSI observations easily leads to model overfitting, resulting in unstable testing performance and limited generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Bayesian nonparametric framework for multiple instance learning, which adopts a cascade of Dirichlet processes (cDP) to incorporate the instance-to-bag characteristic of the WSIs. We perform feature aggregation based on the latent clusters formed by the Dirichlet process, which incorporates the covariances of the patch features and forms more representative clusters. We then perform bag-level prediction with another Dirichlet process model on the bags, which imposes a natural regularization on learning to prevent overfitting and enhance generalizability. Moreover, as a Bayesian nonparametric method, the cDP model can accurately generate posterior uncertainty, which allows for the detection of outlier samples and tumor localization. Extensive experiments on five WSI benchmarks validate the superior performance of our method, as well as its generalizability and ability to estimate uncertainties.

| **[An efficient framework based on large foundation model for cervical cytopathology whole slide image screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11486v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current cervical cytopathology whole slide image (WSI) screening primarily relies on detection-based approaches, which are limited in performance due to the expense and time-consuming annotation process. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a weakly supervised approach that relies solely on bag-level labels, can effectively alleviate these challenges. Nonetheless, MIL commonly employs frozen pretrained models or self-supervised learning for feature extraction, which suffers from low efficacy or inefficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for cervical cytopathology WSI classification using only WSI-level labels through unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. Given the sparse and dispersed nature of abnormal cells within cytopathological WSIs, we propose a strategy that leverages the pretrained foundation model to filter the top$k$ high-risk patches. Subsequently, we suggest parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large foundation model using contrastive learning on the filtered patches to enhance its representation ability for task-specific signals. By training only the added linear adapters, we enhance the learning of patch-level features with substantially reduced time and memory consumption. Experiments conducted on the CSD and FNAC 2019 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of various MIL methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/TCT-InfoNCE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Weakly-Supervised Histopathology Image Segmentation with Knowledge Distillation on MIL-Based Pseudo-Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10274v1)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmenting tumors in histological images is vital for cancer diagnosis. While fully supervised models excel with pixel-level annotations, creating such annotations is labor-intensive and costly. Accurate histopathology image segmentation under weakly-supervised conditions with coarse-grained image labels is still a challenging problem. Although multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown promise in segmentation tasks, surprisingly, no previous pseudo-supervision methods have used MIL-based outputs as pseudo-masks for training. We suspect this stems from concerns over noises in MIL results affecting pseudo supervision quality. To explore the potential of leveraging MIL-based segmentation for pseudo supervision, we propose a novel distillation framework for histopathology image segmentation. This framework introduces a iterative fusion-knowledge distillation strategy, enabling the student model to learn directly from the teacher's comprehensive outcomes. Through dynamic role reversal between the fixed teacher and learnable student models and the incorporation of weighted cross-entropy loss for model optimization, our approach prevents performance deterioration and noise amplification during knowledge distillation. Experimental results on public histopathology datasets, Camelyon16 and Digestpath2019, demonstrate that our approach not only complements various MIL-based segmentation methods but also significantly enhances their performance. Additionally, our method achieves new SOTA in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[FALFormer: Feature-aware Landmarks self-attention for Whole-slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07340v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slide-level classification for whole-slide images (WSIs) has been widely recognized as a crucial problem in digital and computational pathology. Current approaches commonly consider WSIs as a bag of cropped patches and process them via multiple instance learning due to the large number of patches, which cannot fully explore the relationship among patches; in other words, the global information cannot be fully incorporated into decision making. Herein, we propose an efficient and effective slide-level classification model, named as FALFormer, that can process a WSI as a whole so as to fully exploit the relationship among the entire patches and to improve the classification performance. FALFormer is built based upon Transformers and self-attention mechanism. To lessen the computational burden of the original self-attention mechanism and to process the entire patches together in a WSI, FALFormer employs Nystr\"om self-attention which approximates the computation by using a smaller number of tokens or landmarks. For effective learning, FALFormer introduces feature-aware landmarks to enhance the representation power of the landmarks and the quality of the approximation. We systematically evaluate the performance of FALFormer using two public datasets, including CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA. The experimental results demonstrate that FALFormer achieves superior performance on both datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for the slide-level classification. This suggests that FALFormer can facilitate an accurate and precise analysis of WSIs, potentially leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis on WSIs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

The pursuit of automated LGE MRI quality assessment is critical for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, standardizing evaluations, and improving patient outcomes. The deep learning models aimed at automating this process face significant challenges due to the scarcity of expert annotations, high computational costs, and the need to capture subtle diagnostic details in highly variable images. This study introduces HAMIL-QA, a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, designed to overcome these obstacles. HAMIL-QA employs a hierarchical bag and sub-bag structure that allows for targeted analysis within sub-bags and aggregates insights at the volume level. This hierarchical MIL approach reduces reliance on extensive annotations, lessens computational load, and ensures clinically relevant quality predictions by focusing on diagnostically critical image features. Our experiments show that HAMIL-QA surpasses existing MIL methods and traditional supervised approaches in accuracy, AUROC, and F1-Score on an LGE MRI scan dataset, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution for LGE MRI quality assessment automation.

| **[Multiple Instance Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06544v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore multiple-instance verification, a problem setting where a query instance is verified against a bag of target instances with heterogeneous, unknown relevancy. We show that naive adaptations of attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods and standard verification methods like Siamese neural networks are unsuitable for this setting: directly combining state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and Siamese networks is shown to be no better, and sometimes significantly worse, than a simple baseline model. Postulating that this may be caused by the failure of the representation of the target bag to incorporate the query instance, we introduce a new pooling approach named ``cross-attention pooling'' (CAP). Under the CAP framework, we propose two novel attention functions to address the challenge of distinguishing between highly similar instances in a target bag. Through empirical studies on three different verification tasks, we demonstrate that CAP outperforms adaptations of SOTA MIL methods and the baseline by substantial margins, in terms of both classification accuracy and quality of the explanations provided for the classifications. Ablation studies confirm the superior ability of the new attention functions to identify key instances.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Deep Domain Adaptation for Ordinal Regression of Pain Intensity Estimation Using Weakly-Labelled Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06392v3)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimation of pain intensity from facial expressions captured in videos has an immense potential for health care applications. Given the challenges related to subjective variations of facial expressions, and operational capture conditions, the accuracy of state-of-the-art DL models for recognizing facial expressions may decline. Domain adaptation has been widely explored to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occur between video data captured across various source and target domains. Moreover, given the laborious task of collecting and annotating videos, and subjective bias due to ambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning is gaining attention in such applications. State-of-the-art WSL models are typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the ordinal relationship among pain intensity levels, nor temporal coherence of multiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new DL model for weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression that can be adapted using target domain videos with coarse labels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR model enforces ordinal relationships among intensity levels assigned to target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level labels. In particular, it learns discriminant and domain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple instance learning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from target domain. The proposed approach was validated using RECOLA video dataset as fully-labeled source domain data, and UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain video dataset as weakly-labeled target domain data. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue datasets for sequence level estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for a journal. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1910.08173</p></details> |
| **[Deep Weakly-Supervised Domain Adaptation for Pain Localization in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08173v3)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic pain assessment has an important potential diagnostic value for populations that are incapable of articulating their pain experiences. As one of the dominating nonverbal channels for eliciting pain expression events, facial expressions has been widely investigated for estimating the pain intensity of individual. However, using state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models in real-world pain estimation applications poses several challenges related to the subjective variations of facial expressions, operational capture conditions, and lack of representative training videos with labels. Given the cost of annotating intensity levels for every video frame, we propose a weakly-supervised domain adaptation (WSDA) technique that allows for training 3D CNNs for spatio-temporal pain intensity estimation using weakly labeled videos, where labels are provided on a periodic basis. In particular, WSDA integrates multiple instance learning into an adversarial deep domain adaptation framework to train an Inflated 3D-CNN (I3D) model such that it can accurately estimate pain intensities in the target operational domain. The training process relies on weak target loss, along with domain loss and source loss for domain adaptation of the I3D model. Experimental results obtained using labeled source domain RECOLA videos and weakly-labeled target domain UNBC-McMaster videos indicate that the proposed deep WSDA approach can achieve significantly higher level of sequence (bag)-level and frame (instance)-level pain localization accuracy than related state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | Accepted in FG 2020 |
| **[Attention-Challenging Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07125v4)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the application of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, attention mechanisms often focus on a subset of discriminative instances, which are closely linked to overfitting. To mitigate overfitting, we present Attention-Challenging MIL (ACMIL). ACMIL combines two techniques based on separate analyses for attention value concentration. Firstly, UMAP of instance features reveals various patterns among discriminative instances, with existing attention mechanisms capturing only some of them. To remedy this, we introduce Multiple Branch Attention (MBA) to capture more discriminative instances using multiple attention branches. Secondly, the examination of the cumulative value of Top-K attention scores indicates that a tiny number of instances dominate the majority of attention. In response, we present Stochastic Top-K Instance Masking (STKIM), which masks out a portion of instances with Top-K attention values and allocates their attention values to the remaining instances. The extensive experimental results on three WSI datasets with two pre-trained backbones reveal that our ACMIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, through heatmap visualization and UMAP visualization, this paper extensively illustrates ACMIL's effectiveness in suppressing attention value concentration and overcoming the overfitting challenge.

| **[DGR-MIL: Exploring Diverse Global Representation in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03575v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) stands as a powerful approach in weakly supervised learning, regularly employed in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification for detecting tumorous lesions. However, existing mainstream MIL methods focus on modeling correlation between instances while overlooking the inherent diversity among instances. However, few MIL methods have aimed at diversity modeling, which empirically show inferior performance but with a high computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel MIL aggregation method based on diverse global representation (DGR-MIL), by modeling diversity among instances through a set of global vectors that serve as a summary of all instances. First, we turn the instance correlation into the similarity between instance embeddings and the predefined global vectors through a cross-attention mechanism. This stems from the fact that similar instance embeddings typically would result in a higher correlation with a certain global vector. Second, we propose two mechanisms to enforce the diversity among the global vectors to be more descriptive of the entire bag: (i) positive instance alignment and (ii) a novel, efficient, and theoretically guaranteed diversification learning paradigm. Specifically, the positive instance alignment module encourages the global vectors to align with the center of positive instances (e.g., instances containing tumors in WSI). To further diversify the global representations, we propose a novel diversification learning paradigm leveraging the determinantal point process. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL aggregation models by a substantial margin on the CAMELYON-16 and the TCGA-lung cancer datasets.

| **[Characterizing the Interpretability of Attention Maps in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02484v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting machine learning model decisions is crucial for high-risk applications like healthcare. In digital pathology, large whole slide images (WSIs) are decomposed into smaller tiles and tile-derived features are processed by attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) models to predict WSI-level labels. These networks generate tile-specific attention weights, which can be visualized as attention maps for interpretability. However, a standardized evaluation framework for these maps is lacking, questioning their reliability and ability to detect spurious correlations that can mislead models. We herein propose a framework to assess the ability of attention networks to attend to relevant features in digital pathology by creating artificial model confounders and using dedicated interpretability metrics. Models are trained and evaluated on data with tile modifications correlated with WSI labels, enabling the analysis of model sensitivity to artificial confounders and the accuracy of attention maps in highlighting them. Confounders are introduced either through synthetic tile modifications or through tile ablations based on their specific image-based features, with the latter being used to assess more clinically relevant scenarios. We also analyze the impact of varying confounder quantities at both the tile and WSI levels. Our results show that ABMIL models perform as desired within our framework. While attention maps generally highlight relevant regions, their robustness is affected by the type and number of confounders. Our versatile framework has the potential to be used in the evaluation of various methods and the exploration of image-based features driving model predictions, which could aid in biomarker discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[HistGen: Histopathology Report Generation via Local-Global Feature Encoding and Cross-modal Context Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05396v2)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology serves as the gold standard in cancer diagnosis, with clinical reports being vital in interpreting and understanding this process, guiding cancer treatment and patient care. The automation of histopathology report generation with deep learning stands to significantly enhance clinical efficiency and lessen the labor-intensive, time-consuming burden on pathologists in report writing. In pursuit of this advancement, we introduce HistGen, a multiple instance learning-empowered framework for histopathology report generation together with the first benchmark dataset for evaluation. Inspired by diagnostic and report-writing workflows, HistGen features two delicately designed modules, aiming to boost report generation by aligning whole slide images (WSIs) and diagnostic reports from local and global granularity. To achieve this, a local-global hierarchical encoder is developed for efficient visual feature aggregation from a region-to-slide perspective. Meanwhile, a cross-modal context module is proposed to explicitly facilitate alignment and interaction between distinct modalities, effectively bridging the gap between the extensive visual sequences of WSIs and corresponding highly summarized reports. Experimental results on WSI report generation show the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by a large margin. Moreover, the results of fine-tuning our model on cancer subtyping and survival analysis tasks further demonstrate superior performance compared to SOTA methods, showcasing strong transfer learning capability.

| **[Robust compressive tracking via online weighted multiple instance learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09914v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing a robust object tracker is a challenging task due to factors such as occlusion, motion blur, fast motion, illumination variations, rotation, background clutter, low resolution and deformation across the frames. In the literature, lots of good approaches based on sparse representation have already been presented to tackle the above problems. However, most of the algorithms do not focus on the learning of sparse representation. They only consider the modeling of target appearance and therefore drift away from the target with the imprecise training samples. By considering all the above factors in mind, we have proposed a visual object tracking algorithm by integrating a coarse-to-fine search strategy based on sparse representation and the weighted multiple instance learning (WMIL) algorithm. Compared with the other trackers, our approach has more information of the original signal with less complexity due to the coarse-to-fine search method, and also has weights for important samples. Thus, it can easily discriminate the background features from the foreground. Furthermore, we have also selected the samples from the un-occluded sub-regions to efficiently develop the strong classifier. As a consequence, a stable and robust object tracker is achieved to tackle all the aforementioned problems. Experimental results with quantitative as well as qualitative analysis on challenging benchmark datasets show the accuracy and efficiency of our method.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce Mixture Modeling for Multiple Instance Learning (MMIL), an expectation maximization method that enables the training and calibration of cell-level classifiers using patient-level labels. Our approach can be used to train e.g. lasso logistic regression models, gradient boosted trees, and neural networks. When applied to clinically-annotated, primary patient samples in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), our method accurately identifies cancer cells, generalizes across tissues and treatment timepoints, and selects biologically relevant features. In addition, MMIL is capable of incorporating cell labels into model training when they are known, providing a powerful framework for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. Mixture Modeling for MIL offers a novel approach for cell classification, with significant potential to advance disease understanding and management, especially in scenarios with unknown gold-standard labels and high dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Erin ...</summary><p>Erin Craig and Timothy Keyes contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Recent advances in non-destructive 3D pathology, such as open-top light-sheet microscopy, enable comprehensive imaging of spatially heterogeneous tissue morphologies, offering the feasibility to improve diagnostic determinations. A potential early route towards clinical adoption for 3D pathology is to rely on pathologists for final diagnosis based on viewing familiar 2D H&E-like image sections from the 3D datasets. However, manual examination of the massive 3D pathology datasets is infeasible. To address this, we present CARP3D, a deep learning triage approach that automatically identifies the highest-risk 2D slices within 3D volumetric biopsy, enabling time-efficient review by pathologists. For a given slice in the biopsy, we estimate its risk by performing attention-based aggregation of 2D patches within each slice, followed by pooling of the neighboring slices to compute a context-aware 2.5D risk score. For prostate cancer risk stratification, CARP3D achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 90.4% for triaging slices, outperforming methods relying on independent analysis of 2D sections (AUC=81.3%). These results suggest that integrating additional depth context enhances the model's discriminative capabilities. In conclusion, CARP3D has the potential to improve pathologist diagnosis via accurate triage of high-risk slices within large-volume 3D pathology datasets.</p></details> | CVPR CVMI 2024 |

A critical aspect of this analysis is aggregating information from these tiles to make predictions at the WSI level. We introduce a model that combines a message-passing graph neural network (GNN) with a state space model (Mamba) to capture both local and global spatial relationships among the tiles in WSIs. The model's effectiveness was demonstrated in predicting progression-free survival among patients with early-stage lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD). We compared the model with other state-of-the-art methods for tile-level information aggregation in WSIs, including tile-level information summary statistics-based aggregation, multiple instance learning (MIL)-based aggregation, GNN-based aggregation, and GNN-transformer-based aggregation. Additional experiments showed the impact of different types of node features and different tile sampling strategies on the model performance.

In this paradigm, our observation reveals that discriminative embeddings are crucial for aggregation to the final prediction. Among all feature updating strategies, task-oriented ones can capture characteristics specifically for certain tasks. However, they can be prone to overfitting and contaminated by samples assigned with noisy labels. To address this issue, we propose a heuristic clustering-driven feature fine-tuning method (HC-FT) to enhance the performance of multiple instance learning by providing purified positive and hard negative samples. Our method first employs a well-trained MIL model to evaluate the confidence of patches. Then, patches with high confidence are marked as positive samples, while the remaining patches are used to identify crucial negative samples. After two rounds of heuristic clustering and selection, purified positive and hard negative samples are obtained to facilitate feature fine-tuning. The proposed method is evaluated on both CAMELYON16 and BRACS datasets, achieving an AUC of 97.13% and 85.85%, respectively, consistently outperforming all compared methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods often rely on supervised learning, which does not fully account for the sparsity and locality of patterns in time series data (e.g., diseases-related anomalous points in ECG). To address this challenge, we formally reformulate MTSC as a weakly supervised problem, introducing a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for better localization of patterns of interest and modeling time dependencies within time series. Our novel approach, TimeMIL, formulates the temporal correlation and ordering within a time-aware MIL pooling, leveraging a tokenized transformer with a specialized learnable wavelet positional token.

Recently, visual foundation models, such as Segment Anything (SAM), have gained widespread usage due to their robust zero-shot capabilities and exceptional annotation performance. However, SAM's class-agnostic output and high confidence in local segmentation introduce 'semantic ambiguity', posing a challenge for precise category-specific segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a cost-effective category-specific segmenter using SAM. To tackle this challenge, we have devised a Semantic-Aware Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet) that integrates Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with matching capability and SAM with point prompts. SAPNet strategically selects the most representative mask proposals generated by SAM to supervise segmentation, with a specific focus on object category information. Moreover, we introduce the Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to mitigate inherent challenges: 'group' and 'local' issues in weakly supervised segmentation. These strategies serve to further enhance the overall segmentation performance. The experimental results on Pascal VOC and COCO demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed SAPNet, emphasizing its semantic matching capabilities and its potential to advance point-prompted instance segmentation.

Grading is a prime factor for patient risk stratification, although it suffers from inconsistencies and variations among pathologists. Moreover, absence of annotations in medical imaging difficults training deep learning models. To address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline designed for bladder cancer grading using histological slides. First, it extracts urothelium tissue tiles at different magnification levels, employing a convolutional neural network for processing for feature extraction. Then, it engages in the slide-level prediction process. It employs a nested multiple instance learning approach with attention to predict the grade. To distinguish different levels of malignancy within specific regions of the slide, we include the origins of the tiles in our analysis. The attention scores at region level is shown to correlate with verified high-grade regions, giving some explainability to the model.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel three-part framework comprising of a convolutional network based tissue segmentation algorithm for region of interest delineation, a contrastive learning module for feature extraction, and a nested multiple instance learning classification module. Our study explores the significance of various regions of interest within the histopathological slides and exploits diverse learning scenarios. The pipeline is initially validated on artificially generated data and a simpler diagnostic task. Transitioning to prognostic prediction, tasks become more challenging.

However, due to their weak supervision nature, the MIL methods were susceptible to overfitting and required assistance in developing comprehensive representations of target instances. While regularization typically effectively combated overfitting, its integration with the MIL model has been frequently overlooked in prior studies. Meanwhile, current regularization methods for MIL have shown limitations in their capacity to uncover a diverse array of representations. In this study, we delve into the realm of regularization within the MIL model, presenting a novel approach in the form of a Progressive Dropout Layer (PDL). We aim to not only address overfitting but also empower the MIL model in uncovering intricate and impactful feature representations. The proposed method was orthogonal to existing MIL methods and could be easily integrated into them to boost performance. Our extensive evaluation across a range of MIL benchmark datasets demonstrated that the incorporation of the PDL into multiple MIL methods not only elevated their classification performance but also augmented their potential for weakly-supervised feature localizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available in https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/PDL</p></details> |

Previously, learning representations for gigapixel-sized whole slide images (WSIs) has relied on multiple instance learning with weak labels, which do not annotate the diverse morphologic features and spatial heterogeneity of WSIs. A high-quality self-supervised learning method for WSIs would provide transferable visual representations for downstream computational pathology tasks, without the need for dense annotations. We present Slide Pre-trained Transformers (SPT) for gigapixel-scale self-supervision of WSIs. Treating WSI patches as tokens, SPT combines data transformation strategies from language and vision modeling into a general and unified framework to generate views of WSIs for self-supervised pretraining. SPT leverages the inherent regional heterogeneity, histologic feature variability, and information redundancy within WSIs to learn high-quality whole slide representations. We benchmark SPT visual representations on five diagnostic tasks across three biomedical microscopy datasets. SPT significantly outperforms baselines for histopathologic diagnosis, cancer subtyping, and genetic mutation prediction. Finally, we demonstrate that SPT consistently improves whole slide representations when using off-the-shelf, in-domain, and foundational patch encoders for whole slide multiple instance learning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

Nevertheless, these models face challenges in processing large files, primarily due to their input constraints, which are generally restricted to hundreds or thousands of tokens. Attempts to address this issue in existing models usually consist in extracting only a fraction of the essential information from lengthy inputs, while often incurring high computational costs due to their complex architectures. In this work, we address the challenge of classifying large files from the perspective of correlated multiple instance learning. We introduce LaFiCMIL, a method specifically designed for large file classification. LaFiCMIL is optimized for efficient operation on a single GPU, making it a versatile solution for binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments using seven diverse and comprehensive benchmark datasets to assess LaFiCMIL's effectiveness. By integrating BERT for feature extraction, LaFiCMIL demonstrates exceptional performance, setting new benchmarks across all datasets. A notable achievement of our approach is its ability to scale BERT to handle nearly 20,000 tokens while operating on a single GPU with 32GB of memory. This efficiency, coupled with its state-of-the-art performance, highlights LaFiCMIL's potential as a groundbreaking approach in the field of large file classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Explaining Black-box Model Predictions via Two-level Nested Feature Attributions with Consistency Property](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14522v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Techniques that explain the predictions of black-box machine learning models are crucial to make the models transparent, thereby increasing trust in AI systems. The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Multiple Instance Learning: Full Resolution All-In-Memory End-To-End Pathology Slide Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04865v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential to improve health outcomes by training systems on vast digitized clinical datasets. Computational Pathology, with its massive amounts of microscopy image data and impact on diagnostics and biomarkers, is at the forefront of this development. Gigapixel pathology slides pose a unique challenge due to their enormous size and are usually divided into tens of thousands of smaller tiles for analysis. This results in a discontinuity in the machine learning process by separating the training of tile-level encoders from slide-level aggregators and the need to adopt weakly supervised learning strategies. Training models from entire pathology slides end-to-end has been largely unexplored due to its computational challenges. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach to jointly train both a tile encoder and a slide-aggregator fully in memory and end-to-end at high-resolution, bridging the gap between input and slide-level supervision. While more computationally expensive, detailed quantitative validation shows promise for large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning of pathology foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Morphological Prototyping for Unsupervised Slide Representation Learning in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11643v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) has been has primarily relied on weak supervision with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). However, the slide representations resulting from this approach are highly tailored to specific clinical tasks, which limits their expressivity and generalization, particularly in scenarios with limited data. Instead, we hypothesize that morphological redundancy in tissue can be leveraged to build a task-agnostic slide representation in an unsupervised fashion. To this end, we introduce PANTHER, a prototype-based approach rooted in the Gaussian mixture model that summarizes the set of WSI patches into a much smaller set of morphological prototypes. Specifically, each patch is assumed to have been generated from a mixture distribution, where each mixture component represents a morphological exemplar. Utilizing the estimated mixture parameters, we then construct a compact slide representation that can be readily used for a wide range of downstream tasks. By performing an extensive evaluation of PANTHER on subtyping and survival tasks using 13 datasets, we show that 1) PANTHER outperforms or is on par with supervised MIL baselines and 2) the analysis of morphological prototypes brings new qualitative and quantitative insights into model interpretability.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[SI-MIL: Taming Deep MIL for Self-Interpretability in Gigapixel Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15010v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introducing interpretability and reasoning into Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods for Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis is challenging, given the complexity of gigapixel slides. Traditionally, MIL interpretability is limited to identifying salient regions deemed pertinent for downstream tasks, offering little insight to the end-user (pathologist) regarding the rationale behind these selections. To address this, we propose Self-Interpretable MIL (SI-MIL), a method intrinsically designed for interpretability from the very outset. SI-MIL employs a deep MIL framework to guide an interpretable branch grounded on handcrafted pathological features, facilitating linear predictions. Beyond identifying salient regions, SI-MIL uniquely provides feature-level interpretations rooted in pathological insights for WSIs. Notably, SI-MIL, with its linear prediction constraints, challenges the prevalent myth of an inevitable trade-off between model interpretability and performance, demonstrating competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on WSI-level prediction tasks across three cancer types. In addition, we thoroughly benchmark the local and global-interpretability of SI-MIL in terms of statistical analysis, a domain expert study, and desiderata of interpretability, namely, user-friendliness and faithfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Domain Shift in Multiple Instance Learning for Digital Pathology Using Fréchet Domain Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09934v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-instance learning (MIL) is an attractive approach for digital pathology applications as it reduces the costs related to data collection and labelling. However, it is not clear how sensitive MIL is to clinically realistic domain shifts, i.e., differences in data distribution that could negatively affect performance, and if already existing metrics for detecting domain shifts work well with these algorithms. We trained an attention-based MIL algorithm to classify whether a whole-slide image of a lymph node contains breast tumour metastases. The algorithm was evaluated on data from a hospital in a different country and various subsets of this data that correspond to different levels of domain shift. Our contributions include showing that MIL for digital pathology is affected by clinically realistic differences in data, evaluating which features from a MIL model are most suitable for detecting changes in performance, and proposing an unsupervised metric named Fr\'echet Domain Distance (FDD) for quantification of domain shifts. Shift measure performance was evaluated through the mean Pearson correlation to change in classification performance, where FDD achieved 0.70 on 10-fold cross-validation models. The baselines included Deep ensemble, Difference of Confidence, and Representation shift which resulted in 0.45, -0.29, and 0.56 mean Pearson correlation, respectively. FDD could be a valuable tool for care providers and vendors who need to verify if a MIL system is likely to perform reliably when implemented at a new site, without requiring any additional annotations from pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Partial Label Proportions for Whole Slide Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09041v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the segmentation of tumor subtypes in whole slide images (WSI) by utilizing incomplete label proportions. Specifically, we utilize `partial' label proportions, which give the proportions among tumor subtypes but do not give the proportion between tumor and non-tumor. Partial label proportions are recorded as the standard diagnostic information by pathologists, and we, therefore, want to use them for realizing the segmentation model that can classify each WSI patch into one of the tumor subtypes or non-tumor. We call this problem ``learning from partial label proportions (LPLP)'' and formulate the problem as a weakly supervised learning problem. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for this challenging problem by decomposing it into two weakly supervised learning subproblems: multiple instance learning (MIL) and learning from label proportions (LLP). These subproblems are optimized efficiently in the end-to-end manner. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through experiments conducted on two WSI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI2024</p></details> |
| **[Siamese Learning with Joint Alignment and Regression for Weakly-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11463v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Paragraph Grounding (VPG) is an emerging task in video-language understanding, which aims at localizing multiple sentences with semantic relations and temporal order from an untrimmed video. However, existing VPG approaches are heavily reliant on a considerable number of temporal labels that are laborious and time-consuming to acquire. In this work, we introduce and explore Weakly-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (WSVPG) to eliminate the need of temporal annotations. Different from previous weakly-supervised grounding frameworks based on multiple instance learning or reconstruction learning for two-stage candidate ranking, we propose a novel siamese learning framework that jointly learns the cross-modal feature alignment and temporal coordinate regression without timestamp labels to achieve concise one-stage localization for WSVPG. Specifically, we devise a Siamese Grounding TRansformer (SiamGTR) consisting of two weight-sharing branches for learning complementary supervision. An Augmentation Branch is utilized for directly regressing the temporal boundaries of a complete paragraph within a pseudo video, and an Inference Branch is designed to capture the order-guided feature correspondence for localizing multiple sentences in a normal video. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that our paradigm has superior practicability and flexibility to achieve efficient weakly-supervised or semi-supervised learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained with the same or stronger supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024. v2: fix a typo in figure 1</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification: A Good Instance Classifier is All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02249v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised whole slide image classification is usually formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where each slide is treated as a bag, and the patches cut out of it are treated as instances. Existing methods either train an instance classifier through pseudo-labeling or aggregate instance features into a bag feature through attention mechanisms and then train a bag classifier, where the attention scores can be used for instance-level classification. However, the pseudo instance labels constructed by the former usually contain a lot of noise, and the attention scores constructed by the latter are not accurate enough, both of which affect their performance. In this paper, we propose an instance-level MIL framework based on contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively accomplish both instance classification and bag classification tasks. To this end, we propose an instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning algorithm for the first time under the MIL setting to effectively learn instance feature representation. We also propose an accurate pseudo label generation method through prototype learning. We then develop a joint training strategy for weakly supervised contrastive learning, prototype learning, and instance classifier training. Extensive experiments and visualizations on four datasets demonstrate the powerful performance of our method.

Existing UE schemes usually assume that there are completely-labeled samples to support fully-supervised learning. In practice, however, many UE tasks often have no sufficiently-labeled data to use, such as the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with only weak instance annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper, for the first time, addresses the weakly-supervised issue of Multi-Instance UE (MIUE) and proposes a new baseline scheme, Multi-Instance Residual Evidential Learning (MIREL). Particularly, at the fine-grained instance UE with only weak supervision, we derive a multi-instance residual operator through the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions. On this operator derivation, we further propose MIREL to jointly model the high-order predictive distribution at bag and instance levels for MIUE. Extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that our MIREL not only could often make existing MIL networks perform better in MIUE, but also could surpass representative UE methods by large margins, especially in instance-level UE tasks.

Head and neck cancer is diagnosed in specialist centres after a surgical biopsy, however, there is a potential for these to be missed leading to delayed diagnosis. To overcome these challenges, we present an attention based pipeline that identifies suspected lesions, segments, and classifies them as non-dysplastic, dysplastic and cancerous lesions. We propose (a) a vision transformer based Mask R-CNN network for lesion detection and segmentation of clinical images, and (b) Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) based scheme for classification. Current results show that the segmentation model produces segmentation masks and bounding boxes with up to 82% overlap accuracy score on unseen external test data and surpassing reviewed segmentation benchmarks. Next, a classification F1-score of 85% on the internal cohort test set. An app has been developed to perform lesion segmentation taken via a smart device.

However, they are sensitive to spurious correlations, often taking advantage of dataset bias to improve results for in-domain data, but jeopardizing their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose to limit the amount of information these models use to reach the final classification, by using a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework. MIL forces the model to use only a (small) subset of patches in the image, identifying discriminative regions. This mimics the clinical procedures, where medical decisions are based on localized findings. We evaluate our framework on two medical applications: skin cancer diagnosis using dermoscopy and breast cancer diagnosis using mammography. Our results show that using only a subset of the patches does not compromise diagnostic performance for in-domain data, compared to the baseline approaches. However, our approach is more robust to shifts in patient demographics, while also providing more detailed explanations about which regions contributed to the decision.

Existing deep learning approaches mainly adopt multiple instance learning or graph neural networks under weak supervision. Most of them are unable to uncover the diverse interactions between different types of biological entities(\textit{e.g.}, cell cluster and tissue block) across multiple scales, while such interactions are crucial for patient survival prediction. In light of this, we propose a novel multi-scale heterogeneity-aware hypergraph representation framework. Specifically, our framework first constructs a multi-scale heterogeneity-aware hypergraph and assigns each node with its biological entity type. It then mines diverse interactions between nodes on the graph structure to obtain a global representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets.

However, to date, there is not a widely available method to reproducibly measure tumor and immune phenotypes for each patient's tumor. Given this unmet clinical need, we applied multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms to assess activity of ten biologically relevant pathways from the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide of primary breast tumors. We employed different feature extraction approaches and state-of-the-art model architectures. Using binary classification, our models attained area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores above 0.70 for nearly all gene expression pathways and on some cases, exceeded 0.80. Attention maps suggest that our trained models recognize biologically relevant spatial patterns of cell sub-populations from H&E.

We address the mislabeling issue in real-time HMDs, where benign segments in malware time-series incorrectly inherit malware labels, leading to increased false positives. Utilizing the proposed Malicious Discriminative Score within the MIL framework, RT-HMD effectively identifies localized malware behaviors, thereby improving the predictive accuracy. Empirical analysis, using a hardware telemetry dataset collected from a mobile platform across 723 benign and 1033 malware samples, shows a 5% precision boost while maintaining recall, outperforming baselines affected by mislabeled benign segments.</p></details> | Under peer review |

Specially, pavement cracks have a highly complex spatial structure, a low contrasting background and a weak spatial continuity, posing a significant challenge to an effective crack detection method. In this paper, we address these problems from a view that utilizes contexts of the cracks and propose an end-to-end deep learning method to model the context information flow. To precisely localize crack from an image, it is critical to effectively extract and aggregate multi-granularity context, including the fine-grained local context around the cracks (in spatial-level) and the coarse-grained semantics (in segment-level). Concretely, in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), low-level features extracted by the shallow layers represent the local information, while the deep layers extract the semantic features. Additionally, a second main insight in this work is that the semantic context should be an guidance to local context feature. By the above insights, the proposed method we first apply the dilated convolution as the backbone feature extractor to model local context, then we build a context guidance module to leverage semantic context to guide local feature extraction at multiple stages. To handle label alignment between stages, we apply the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) strategy to align the high-level feature to the low-level ones in the stage-wise context flow. In addition, compared with these public crack datasets, to our best knowledge, we release the largest, most complex and most challenging Bitumen Pavement Crack (BPC) dataset. The experimental results on the three crack datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs well and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the IDS activity is manually supervised by law enforcers, i.e., law enforcers empirically choose a taxi and inspect it. The pressing problem of this scheme is the dilemma between the limited number of law-enforcers and the large volume of taxis. In this paper, motivated by this problem, we propose a computational method that helps law enforcers efficiently find the taxis which tend to have the IDS activity. Firstly, our method converts the identification of the IDS activity to a supervised learning task. Secondly, two kinds of taxi driver behaviors, i.e., the Sleeping Time and Location (STL) behavior and the Pick-Up (PU) behavior are proposed. Thirdly, the multiple scale pooling on self-similarity is proposed to encode the individual behaviors into the universal features for all taxis. Finally, a Multiple Component- Multiple Instance Learning (MC-MIL) method is proposed to handle the deficiency of the behavior features and to align the behavior features simultaneously. Extensive experiments on a real-world data set shows that the proposed behavior features have a good generalization ability across different classifiers, and the proposed MC-MIL method suppresses the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantics-Aware Attention Guidance for Diagnosing Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10894v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in digital pathology, largely due to the gigapixel size and complex spatial relationships present in whole slide images. Traditional multiple instance learning (MIL) methods often struggle with these intricacies, especially in preserving the necessary context for accurate diagnosis. In response, we introduce a novel framework named Semantics-Aware Attention Guidance (SAG), which includes 1) a technique for converting diagnostically relevant entities into attention signals, and 2) a flexible attention loss that efficiently integrates various semantically significant information, such as tissue anatomy and cancerous regions. Our experiments on two distinct cancer datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy, precision, and recall with two state-of-the-art baseline models. Qualitative analysis further reveals that the incorporation of heuristic guidance enables the model to focus on regions critical for diagnosis. SAG is not only effective for the models discussed here, but its adaptability extends to any attention-based diagnostic model. This opens up exciting possibilities for further improving the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Regions of Interest in Whole Slide Images Using Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01446v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSI), obtained by high-resolution digital scanning of microscope slides at multiple scales, are the cornerstone of modern Digital Pathology. However, they represent a particular challenge to AI-based/AI-mediated analysis because pathology labeling is typically done at slide-level, instead of tile-level. It is not just that medical diagnostics is recorded at the specimen level, the detection of oncogene mutation is also experimentally obtained, and recorded by initiatives like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), at the slide level. This configures a dual challenge: a) accurately predicting the overall cancer phenotype and b) finding out what cellular morphologies are associated with it at the tile level. To address these challenges, a weakly supervised Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach was explored for two prevalent cancer types, Invasive Breast Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-LUSC). This approach was explored for tumor detection at low magnification levels and TP53 mutations at various levels. Our results show that a novel additive implementation of MIL matched the performance of reference implementation (AUC 0.96), and was only slightly outperformed by Attention MIL (AUC 0.97). More interestingly from the perspective of the molecular pathologist, these different AI architectures identify distinct sensitivities to morphological features (through the detection of Regions of Interest, RoI) at different amplification levels. Tellingly, TP53 mutation was most sensitive to features at the higher applications where cellular morphology is resolved.</p></details> |  |

However, clinical adoption of computational models has been hampered by the lack of generalization due to large batch effects, small dataset sizes, and poor performance in transfer learning from natural images. To address these challenges, we introduce DinoBloom, the first foundation model for single cell images in hematology, utilizing a tailored DINOv2 pipeline. Our model is built upon an extensive collection of 13 diverse, publicly available datasets of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears, the most substantial open-source cohort in hematology so far, comprising over 380,000 white blood cell images. To assess its generalization capability, we evaluate it on an external dataset with a challenging domain shift. We show that our model outperforms existing medical and non-medical vision models in (i) linear probing and k-nearest neighbor evaluations for cell-type classification on blood and bone marrow smears and (ii) weakly supervised multiple instance learning for acute myeloid leukemia subtyping by a large margin. A family of four DinoBloom models (small, base, large, and giant) can be adapted for a wide range of downstream applications, be a strong baseline for classification problems, and facilitate the assessment of batch effects in new datasets. All models are available at github.com/marrlab/DinoBloom.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, human or model feedback for evaluating and further tuning LLM performance has been provided at the response level, enabling faster and more cost-effective assessments. However, recent works (Amplayo et al. [2022], Wu et al. [2023]) indicate that sentence-level labels may provide more accurate and interpretable feedback for LLM optimization. In this work, we introduce methods to disaggregate response-level labels into sentence-level (pseudo-)labels. Our approach leverages multiple instance learning (MIL) and learning from label proportions (LLP) techniques in conjunction with prior information (e.g., document-sentence cosine similarity) to train a specialized model for sentence-level scoring. We also employ techniques which use model predictions to pseudo-label the train-set at the sentence-level for model training to further improve performance. We conduct extensive evaluations of our methods across six datasets and four tasks: retrieval, question answering, summarization, and math reasoning. Our results demonstrate improved performance compared to multiple baselines across most of these tasks. Our work is the first to develop response-level feedback to sentence-level scoring techniques, leveraging sentence-level prior information, along with comprehensive evaluations on multiple tasks as well as end-to-end finetuning evaluation showing performance comparable to a model trained on fine-grained human annotated labels.</p></details> | 22 pages, 1 figure |

It is commonly based on leveraging inertial, location, or both types of signals, captured by modern smartphone devices. Each type has benefits (such as increased effectiveness) and drawbacks (such as increased battery consumption) depending on the transportation mode (TM). Combining the two types is challenging as they exhibit significant differences such as very different sampling rates. This paper focuses on the TMR task and proposes an approach for combining the two types of signals in an effective and robust classifier. Our network includes two sub-networks for processing acceleration and location signals separately, using different window sizes for each signal. The two sub-networks are designed to also embed the two types of signals into the same space so that we can then apply an attention-based multiple-instance learning classifier to recognize TM. We use very low sampling rates for both signal types to reduce battery consumption. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a publicly available dataset and compare against other well known algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables, accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Whole Slide Image Classification with Fine-Grained Visual-Semantic Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19326v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification is often formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in WSI classification. However, existing methods leverage coarse-grained pathogenetic descriptions for visual representation supervision, which are insufficient to capture the complex visual appearance of pathogenetic images, hindering the generalizability of models on diverse downstream tasks. Additionally, processing high-resolution WSIs can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel "Fine-grained Visual-Semantic Interaction" (FiVE) framework for WSI classification. It is designed to enhance the model's generalizability by leveraging the interaction between localized visual patterns and fine-grained pathological semantics. Specifically, with meticulously designed queries, we start by utilizing a large language model to extract fine-grained pathological descriptions from various non-standardized raw reports. The output descriptions are then reconstructed into fine-grained labels used for training. By introducing a Task-specific Fine-grained Semantics (TFS) module, we enable prompts to capture crucial visual information in WSIs, which enhances representation learning and augments generalization capabilities significantly. Furthermore, given that pathological visual patterns are redundantly distributed across tissue slices, we sample a subset of visual instances during training. Our method demonstrates robust generalizability and strong transferability, dominantly outperforming the counterparts on the TCGA Lung Cancer dataset with at least 9.19% higher accuracy in few-shot experiments. The code is available at: https://github.com/ls1rius/WSI_FiVE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

This condition is under-diagnosed and under-treated. In clinical practice, AS is diagnosed with expert review of transthoracic echocardiography, which produces dozens of ultrasound images of the heart. Only some of these views show the aortic valve. To automate screening for AS, deep networks must learn to mimic a human expert's ability to identify views of the aortic valve then aggregate across these relevant images to produce a study-level diagnosis. We find previous approaches to AS detection yield insufficient accuracy due to relying on inflexible averages across images. We further find that off-the-shelf attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) performs poorly. We contribute a new end-to-end MIL approach with two key methodological innovations. First, a supervised attention technique guides the learned attention mechanism to favor relevant views. Second, a novel self-supervised pretraining strategy applies contrastive learning on the representation of the whole study instead of individual images as commonly done in prior literature. Experiments on an open-access dataset and an external validation set show that our approach yields higher accuracy while reducing model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Echoc...</summary><p>Echocardiogram; multiple-instance learning; self-supervised learning; semi-supervised learning; medical imaging</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Pathological Image Classification: An Instance Attribute Viewpoint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00351v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a robust paradigm for whole-slide pathological image (WSI) analysis, processing gigapixel-resolution images with slide-level labels. As pioneering efforts, attention-based MIL (ABMIL) and its variants are increasingly becoming popular due to the characteristics of simultaneously handling clinical diagnosis and tumor localization. However, the attention mechanism exhibits limitations in discriminating between instances, which often misclassifies tissues and potentially impairs MIL performance. This paper proposes an Attribute-Driven MIL (AttriMIL) framework to address these issues. Concretely, we dissect the calculation process of ABMIL and present an attribute scoring mechanism that measures the contribution of each instance to bag prediction effectively, quantifying instance attributes. Based on attribute quantification, we develop a spatial attribute constraint and an attribute ranking constraint to model instance correlations within and across slides, respectively. These constraints encourage the network to capture the spatial correlation and semantic similarity of instances, improving the ability of AttriMIL to distinguish tissue types and identify challenging instances. Additionally, AttriMIL employs a histopathology adaptive backbone that maximizes the pre-trained model's feature extraction capability for collecting pathological features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our AttriMIL outperforms existing state-of-the-art frameworks across multiple evaluation metrics. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MedCAI/AttriMIL.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Benchmarking Image Transformers for Prostate Cancer Detection from Ultrasound Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18233v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PURPOSE: Deep learning methods for classifying prostate cancer (PCa) in ultrasound images typically employ convolutional networks (CNNs) to detect cancer in small regions of interest (ROI) along a needle trace region. However, this approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth histopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs. Recently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by combining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to detect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In this work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer architectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a comparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based prostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning strategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label noise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer classification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier with MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning strategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that for both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones lag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more noticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can improve performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a specificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for modelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust features than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the best architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an effective way to improve performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>early...</summary><p>early draft, 7 pages; Accepted to SPIE Medical Imaging 2024</p></details> |
| **[Integrative Graph-Transformer Framework for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Representation and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18134v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In digital pathology, the multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy is widely used in the weakly supervised histopathology whole slide image (WSI) classification task where giga-pixel WSIs are only labeled at the slide level. However, existing attention-based MIL approaches often overlook contextual information and intrinsic spatial relationships between neighboring tissue tiles, while graph-based MIL frameworks have limited power to recognize the long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce the integrative graph-transformer framework that simultaneously captures the context-aware relational features and global WSI representations through a novel Graph Transformer Integration (GTI) block. Specifically, each GTI block consists of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer modeling neighboring relations at the local instance level and an efficient global attention model capturing comprehensive global information from extensive feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and BRIGHT, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art MIL methods, achieving an improvement of 1.0% to 2.6% in accuracy and 0.7%-1.6% in AUROC.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedMIL: Federated-Multiple Instance Learning for Video Analysis with Optimized DPP Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17331v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many AI platforms, including traffic monitoring systems, use Federated Learning (FL) for decentralized sensor data processing for learning-based applications while preserving privacy and ensuring secured information transfer. On the other hand, applying supervised learning to large data samples, like high-resolution images requires intensive human labor to label different parts of a data sample. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) alleviates this challenge by operating over labels assigned to the 'bag' of instances. In this paper, we introduce Federated Multiple-Instance Learning (FedMIL). This framework applies federated learning to boost the training performance in video-based MIL tasks such as vehicle accident detection using distributed CCTV networks. However, data sources in decentralized settings are not typically Independently and Identically Distributed (IID), making client selection imperative to collectively represent the entire dataset with minimal clients. To address this challenge, we propose DPPQ, a framework based on the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) with a quality-based kernel to select clients with the most diverse datasets that achieve better performance compared to both random selection and current DPP-based client selection methods even with less data utilization in the majority of non-IID cases. This offers a significant advantage for deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources, providing a reliable solution for training AI models in massive smart sensor networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating multiscale topology in digital pathology with pyramidal graph convolutional networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15068v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to multiple instance learning with convolutional neural networks in digital pathology, offering superior handling of structural information across various spatial ranges - a crucial aspect of learning from gigapixel H&E-stained whole slide images (WSI). However, graph message-passing algorithms often suffer from oversmoothing when aggregating a large neighborhood. Hence, effective modeling of multi-range interactions relies on the careful construction of the graph. Our proposed multi-scale GCN (MS-GCN) tackles this issue by leveraging information across multiple magnification levels in WSIs. MS-GCN enables the simultaneous modeling of long-range structural dependencies at lower magnifications and high-resolution cellular details at higher magnifications, akin to analysis pipelines usually conducted by pathologists. The architecture's unique configuration allows for the concurrent modeling of structural patterns at lower magnifications and detailed cellular features at higher ones, while also quantifying the contribution of each magnification level to the prediction. Through testing on different datasets, MS-GCN demonstrates superior performance over existing single-magnification GCN methods. The enhancement in performance and interpretability afforded by our method holds promise for advancing computational pathology models, especially in tasks requiring extensive spatial context.</p></details> |  |

Probabilistic MIL methods, and more specifically Gaussian Processes (GPs), have achieved excellent results due to their high expressiveness and uncertainty quantification capabilities. One of the most successful GP-based MIL methods, VGPMIL, resorts to a variational bound to handle the intractability of the logistic function. Here, we formulate VGPMIL using P\'olya-Gamma random variables. This approach yields the same variational posterior approximations as the original VGPMIL, which is a consequence of the two representations that the Hyperbolic Secant distribution admits. This leads us to propose a general GP-based MIL method that takes different forms by simply leveraging distributions other than the Hyperbolic Secant one. Using the Gamma distribution we arrive at a new approach that obtains competitive or superior predictive performance and efficiency. This is validated in a comprehensive experimental study including one synthetic MIL dataset, two well-known MIL benchmarks, and a real-world medical problem. We expect that this work provides useful ideas beyond MIL that can foster further research in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 12 figures, published in Artificial Intelligence Journal</p></details> |

In LML, the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag's label. LML aims to classify instances using bag-level majority classes. This problem is valuable in various applications. Existing MIL methods are unsuitable for LML due to aggregating confidences, which may lead to inconsistency between the bag-level label and the label obtained by counting the number of instances for each class. This may lead to incorrect instance-level classification. We propose a counting network trained to produce the bag-level majority labels estimated by counting the number of instances for each class. This led to the consistency of the majority class between the network outputs and one obtained by counting the number of instances. Experimental results show that our counting network outperforms conventional MIL methods on four datasets The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shiku-Kaito/Counting-Network-for-Learning-from-Majority-Label.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Accepted in ICASSP 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically rely on frozen pre-trained models to extract instance features, neglecting the substantial domain shift between pre-training natural and histopathological images. To address this issue, we propose PAMT, a novel Prompt-guided Adaptive Model Transformation framework that enhances MIL classification performance by seamlessly adapting pre-trained models to the specific characteristics of histopathology data. To capture the intricate histopathology distribution, we introduce Representative Patch Sampling (RPS) and Prototypical Visual Prompt (PVP) to reform the input data, building a compact while informative representation. Furthermore, to narrow the domain gap, we introduce Adaptive Model Transformation (AMT) that integrates adapter blocks within the feature extraction pipeline, enabling the pre-trained models to learn domain-specific features. We rigorously evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets, Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC, showcasing substantial improvements across various MIL models. Our findings affirm the potential of PAMT to set a new benchmark in WSI classification, underscoring the value of a targeted reprogramming approach.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to overcome this issue, and propose a new framework called MILLET: Multiple Instance Learning for Locally Explainable Time series classification. We apply MILLET to existing deep learning TSC models and show how they become inherently interpretable without compromising (and in some cases, even improving) predictive performance. We evaluate MILLET on 85 UCR TSC datasets and also present a novel synthetic dataset that is specially designed to facilitate interpretability evaluation. On these datasets, we show MILLET produces sparse explanations quickly that are of higher quality than other well-known interpretability methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work with MILLET, which is available on GitHub (https://github.com/JAEarly/MILTimeSeriesClassification), is the first to develop general MIL methods for TSC and apply them to an extensive variety of domains</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2024. 29 pages (9 main, 3 ref, 17 appendix)</p></details> |

The current paradigm is mainly based on multiple instance learning (MIL), in which approaches with Transformer as the backbone are well discussed. These methods convert WSI tasks into sequence tasks by representing patches as tokens in the WSI sequence. However, the feature complexity brought by high heterogeneity and the ultra-long sequences brought by gigapixel size makes Transformer-based MIL suffer from the challenges of high memory consumption, slow inference speed, and lack of performance. To this end, we propose a retentive MIL method called RetMIL, which processes WSI sequences through hierarchical feature propagation structure. At the local level, the WSI sequence is divided into multiple subsequences. Tokens of each subsequence are updated through a parallel linear retention mechanism and aggregated utilizing an attention layer. At the global level, subsequences are fused into a global sequence, then updated through a serial retention mechanism, and finally the slide-level representation is obtained through a global attention pooling. We conduct experiments on two public CAMELYON and BRACS datasets and an public-internal LUNG dataset, confirming that RetMIL not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly reduces computational overhead. Our code will be accessed shortly.</p></details> | under review |

An important class of MIL models is instance-based, where we first classify instances and then aggregate those predictions to obtain a bag label. The most common MIL model is when we consider a bag as positive if at least one of its instances has a positive label. However, this reasoning does not hold in many real-life scenarios, where the positive bag label is often a consequence of a certain percentage of positive instances. To address this issue, we introduce a dedicated instance-based method called ProMIL, based on deep neural networks and Bernstein polynomial estimation. An important advantage of ProMIL is that it can automatically detect the optimal percentage level for decision-making. We show that ProMIL outperforms standard instance-based MIL in real-world medical applications. We make the code available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Paper to European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2023)</p></details> |

Despite driving notable progress, existing MIL approaches suffer from limitations in facilitating comprehensive and efficient interactions among instances, as well as challenges related to time-consuming computations and overfitting. In this paper, we incorporate the Selective Scan Space State Sequential Model (Mamba) in Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for long sequence modeling with linear complexity, termed as MambaMIL. By inheriting the capability of vanilla Mamba, MambaMIL demonstrates the ability to comprehensively understand and perceive long sequences of instances. Furthermore, we propose the Sequence Reordering Mamba (SR-Mamba) aware of the order and distribution of instances, which exploits the inherent valuable information embedded within the long sequences. With the SR-Mamba as the core component, MambaMIL can effectively capture more discriminative features and mitigate the challenges associated with overfitting and high computational overhead. Extensive experiments on two public challenging tasks across nine diverse datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework performs favorably against state-of-the-art MIL methods.

However, the data-intensive requirement of these models poses a significant challenge in scenarios with scarce data availability, e.g., in rare diseases. We introduce a topological regularization term to MIL to mitigate this challenge. It provides a shape-preserving inductive bias that compels the encoder to maintain the essential geometrical-topological structure of input bags during projection into latent space. This enhances the performance and generalization of the MIL classifier regardless of the aggregation function, particularly for scarce training data. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed through experiments across a range of datasets, showing an average enhancement of 2.8% for MIL benchmarks, 15.3% for synthetic MIL datasets, and 5.5% for real-world biomedical datasets over the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning pipelines for assessing AS from echocardiograms have two key limitations. First, most methods rely on limited 2D cineloops, thereby ignoring widely available Doppler imaging that contains important complementary information about pressure gradients and blood flow abnormalities associated with AS. Second, obtaining labeled data is difficult. There are often far more unlabeled echocardiogram recordings available, but these remain underutilized by existing methods. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semi-supervised Multimodal Multiple-Instance Learning (SMMIL), a new deep learning framework for automatic interpretation for structural heart diseases like AS. When deployed, SMMIL can combine information from two input modalities, spectral Dopplers and 2D cineloops, to produce a study-level AS diagnosis. During training, SMMIL can combine a smaller labeled set and an abundant unlabeled set of both modalities to improve its classifier. Experiments demonstrate that SMMIL outperforms recent alternatives at 3-level AS severity classification as well as several clinically relevant AS detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Echoc...</summary><p>Echocardiography; Multimodal; Semi-supervised Learning; Multiple-Instance Learning</p></details> |

Despite its promising benefits, questions concerning performance trends for varying sample sizes and its influence on model interpretability remain. Addressing these, we reach an optimal performance enhancement of 1.7% using thirty percent of patches on the CAMELYON16 dataset, and 3.7% with only eight samples on the TUPAC16 dataset. We also find interpretability effects are strongly dataset-dependent, with interpretability impacted on CAMELYON16, while remaining unaffected on TUPAC16. This reinforces that both the performance and interpretability relationships with sampling are closely task-specific. End-to-end training with 1024 samples reveals improvements across both datasets compared to pre-extracted features, further highlighting the potential of this efficient approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE ...</summary><p>SPIE Medical Imaging 2024</p></details> |

Feature extractor models that were pre-trained with supervision on ImageNet have proven to transfer well to this domain, however, this pre-training task does not take into account that visual information in neighboring patches is highly correlated. Based on this observation, we propose to increase downstream MIL classification by fine-tuning the feature extractor model using \textit{Masked Context Modelling with Knowledge Distillation}. In this task, the feature extractor model is fine-tuned by predicting masked patches in a bigger context window. Since reconstructing the input image would require a powerful image generation model, and our goal is not to generate realistically looking image patches, we predict instead the feature vectors produced by a larger teacher network. A single epoch of the proposed task suffices to increase the downstream performance of the feature-extractor model when used in a MIL scenario, even capable of outperforming the downstream performance of the teacher model, while being considerably smaller and requiring a fraction of its compute.</p></details> |  |

Alternatively, learning fine-grained visual representation from enormous unlabeled images (e.g., species, brands) by self-supervised learning becomes a feasible solution. However, recent researches find that existing self-supervised learning methods are less qualified to represent fine-grained categories. The bottleneck lies in that the pre-text representation is built from every patch-wise embedding, while fine-grained categories are only determined by several key patches of an image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation (CMD) framework to tackle the challenge. Our key idea is to consider the importance of each image patch in determining the fine-grained pre-text representation by multiple instance learning. To comprehensively learn the relation between informative patches and fine-grained semantics, the multi-instance knowledge distillation is implemented on both the region/image crop pairs from the teacher and student net, and the region-image crops inside the teacher / student net, which we term as intra-level multi-instance distillation and inter-level multi-instance distillation. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft show that the proposed method outperforms the contemporary method by upto 10.14% and existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches by upto 19.78% on both top-1 accuracy and Rank-1 retrieval metric.</p></details> | work in progress |

We train a controller function to localise regions of interest within an image by introducing a novel reward definition that utilises non-binarised classification probability, generated by a pre-trained binary classifier which classifies object presence in images or image crops. The object-presence classifier may then inform the controller of its localisation quality by quantifying the likelihood of the image containing an object. Such an approach allows us to minimize any potential labelling or human bias propagated via human labelling for fully supervised localisation. We evaluate our proposed approach for a task of cancerous lesion localisation on a large dataset of real clinical bi-parametric MR images of the prostate. Comparisons to the commonly used multiple-instance learning weakly supervised localisation and to a fully supervised baseline show that our proposed method outperforms the multi-instance learning and performs comparably to fully-supervised learning, using only image-level classification labels for training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISBI 2024 (21st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging)</p></details> |

The successes of multiple instance learning in this task for natural images, however, do not translate well to medical images due to the very different characteristics of their objects (i.e. pathologies). In this work, we propose Weakly Supervised ROI Proposal Networks (WSRPN), a new method for generating bounding box proposals on the fly using a specialized region of interest-attention (ROI-attention) module. WSRPN integrates well with classic backbone-head classification algorithms and is end-to-end trainable with only image-label supervision.

| **[Compact and De-biased Negative Instance Embedding for Multi-Instance Learning on Whole-Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10595v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) classification is a challenging task because 1) patches from WSI lack annotation, and 2) WSI possesses unnecessary variability, e.g., stain protocol. Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms. We release our code at https://github.com/AITRICS/pathology_mil.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Multiple Instance Learning for Weakly Supervised Person ReID](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07685v1)** | 2024-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The acquisition of large-scale, precisely labeled datasets for person re-identification (ReID) poses a significant challenge. Weakly supervised ReID has begun to address this issue, although its performance lags behind fully supervised methods. In response, we introduce Contrastive Multiple Instance Learning (CMIL), a novel framework tailored for more effective weakly supervised ReID. CMIL distinguishes itself by requiring only a single model and no pseudo labels while leveraging contrastive losses -- a technique that has significantly enhanced traditional ReID performance yet is absent in all prior MIL-based approaches. Through extensive experiments and analysis across three datasets, CMIL not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale SYSU-30k dataset with fewer assumptions but also consistently outperforms all baselines on the WL-market1501 and Weakly Labeled MUddy racer re-iDentification dataset (WL-MUDD) datasets. We introduce and release the WL-MUDD dataset, an extension of the MUDD dataset featuring naturally occurring weak labels from the real-world application at PerformancePhoto.co.

| **[Multiple Instance Learning for Cheating Detection and Localization in Online Examinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06107v1)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spread of the Coronavirus disease-2019 epidemic has caused many courses and exams to be conducted online. The cheating behavior detection model in examination invigilation systems plays a pivotal role in guaranteeing the equality of long-distance examinations. However, cheating behavior is rare, and most researchers do not comprehensively take into account features such as head posture, gaze angle, body posture, and background information in the task of cheating behavior detection. In this paper, we develop and present CHEESE, a CHEating detection framework via multiplE inStancE learning. The framework consists of a label generator that implements weak supervision and a feature encoder to learn discriminative features. In addition, the framework combines body posture and background features extracted by 3D convolution with eye gaze, head posture and facial features captured by OpenFace 2.0. These features are fed into the spatio-temporal graph module by stitching to analyze the spatio-temporal changes in video clips to detect the cheating behaviors. Our experiments on three datasets, UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech and Online Exam Proctoring (OEP), prove the effectiveness of our method as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, and obtain the frame-level AUC score of 87.58% on the OEP dataset.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation instead of traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods over two distinct cancer datasets by a margin of up to 10% balanced accuracy, while being 7 times smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art model in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers and is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology. Furthermore, we publish two large graph datasets of rare Ovarian and Bladder cancers to contribute to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early version: To be updated</p></details> |
| **[The Rise of AI Language Pathologists: Exploring Two-level Prompt Learning for Few-shot Weakly-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17891v2)** | 2024-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the novel concept of few-shot weakly supervised learning for pathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, denoted as FSWC. A solution is proposed based on prompt learning and the utilization of a large language model, GPT-4. Since a WSI is too large and needs to be divided into patches for processing, WSI classification is commonly approached as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. In this context, each WSI is considered a bag, and the obtained patches are treated as instances. The objective of FSWC is to classify both bags and instances with only a limited number of labeled bags. Unlike conventional few-shot learning problems, FSWC poses additional challenges due to its weak bag labels within the MIL framework. Drawing inspiration from the recent achievements of vision-language models (V-L models) in downstream few-shot classification tasks, we propose a two-level prompt learning MIL framework tailored for pathology, incorporating language prior knowledge. Specifically, we leverage CLIP to extract instance features for each patch, and introduce a prompt-guided pooling strategy to aggregate these instance features into a bag feature. Subsequently, we employ a small number of labeled bags to facilitate few-shot prompt learning based on the bag features. Our approach incorporates the utilization of GPT-4 in a question-and-answer mode to obtain language prior knowledge at both the instance and bag levels, which are then integrated into the instance and bag level language prompts. Additionally, a learnable component of the language prompts is trained using the available few-shot labeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on three real WSI datasets encompassing breast cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer, demonstrating the notable performance of the proposed method in bag and instance classification. All codes will be available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Learning Prompt-Enhanced Context Features for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14451v2)** | 2024-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection under weak supervision presents significant challenges, particularly due to the lack of frame-level annotations during training. While prior research has utilized graph convolution networks and self-attention mechanisms alongside multiple instance learning (MIL)-based classification loss to model temporal relations and learn discriminative features, these methods often employ multi-branch architectures to capture local and global dependencies separately, resulting in increased parameters and computational costs. Moreover, the coarse-grained interclass separability provided by the binary constraint of MIL-based loss neglects the fine-grained discriminability within anomalous classes. In response, this paper introduces a weakly supervised anomaly detection framework that focuses on efficient context modeling and enhanced semantic discriminability. We present a Temporal Context Aggregation (TCA) module that captures comprehensive contextual information by reusing the similarity matrix and implementing adaptive fusion. Additionally, we propose a Prompt-Enhanced Learning (PEL) module that integrates semantic priors using knowledge-based prompts to boost the discriminative capacity of context features while ensuring separability between anomaly sub-classes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method's components, demonstrating competitive performance with reduced parameters and computational effort on three challenging benchmarks: UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech datasets. Notably, our approach significantly improves the detection accuracy of certain anomaly sub-classes, underscoring its practical value and efficacy.

| **[BoNuS: Boundary Mining for Nuclei Segmentation with Partial Point Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07437v1)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclei segmentation is a fundamental prerequisite in the digital pathology workflow. The development of automated methods for nuclei segmentation enables quantitative analysis of the wide existence and large variances in nuclei morphometry in histopathology images. However, manual annotation of tens of thousands of nuclei is tedious and time-consuming, which requires significant amount of human effort and domain-specific expertise. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised nuclei segmentation method that only requires partial point labels of nuclei. Specifically, we propose a novel boundary mining framework for nuclei segmentation, named BoNuS, which simultaneously learns nuclei interior and boundary information from the point labels. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel boundary mining loss, which guides the model to learn the boundary information by exploring the pairwise pixel affinity in a multiple-instance learning manner. Then, we consider a more challenging problem, i.e., partial point label, where we propose a nuclei detection module with curriculum learning to detect the missing nuclei with prior morphological knowledge. The proposed method is validated on three public datasets, MoNuSeg, CPM, and CoNIC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method to the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised nuclei segmentation methods.

| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15254v3)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The whole slide image (WSI) classification is often formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. Since the positive tissue is only a small fraction of the gigapixel WSI, existing MIL methods intuitively focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting hard-to-classify instances. Some literature has revealed that hard examples are beneficial for modeling a discriminative boundary accurately. By applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which uses a Siamese structure (Teacher-Student) with a consistency constraint to explore the potential hard instances. With several instance masking strategies based on attention scores, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model, which can be any attention-based MIL model. This counter-intuitive strategy essentially enables the student to learn a better discriminating boundary. Moreover, the student is used to update the teacher with an exponential moving average (EMA), which in turn identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes the optimization. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms other latest methods in terms of performance and training cost.

| **[Multiple Instance Learning for Uplift Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09639v1)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uplift modeling is widely used in performance marketing to estimate effects of promotion campaigns (e.g., increase of customer retention rate). Since it is impossible to observe outcomes of a recipient in treatment (e.g., receiving a certain promotion) and control (e.g., without promotion) groups simultaneously (i.e., counter-factual), uplift models are mainly trained on instances of treatment and control groups separately to form two models respectively, and uplifts are predicted by the difference of predictions from these two models (i.e., two-model method). When responses are noisy and the treatment effect is fractional, induced individual uplift predictions will be inaccurate, resulting in targeting undesirable customers. Though it is impossible to obtain the ideal ground-truth individual uplifts, known as Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs), alternatively, an average uplift of a group of users, called Average Treatment Effect (ATE), can be observed from experimental deliveries. Upon this, similar to Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) in which each training sample is a bag of instances, our framework sums up individual user uplift predictions for each bag of users as its bag-wise ATE prediction, and regularizes it to its ATE label, thus learning more accurate individual uplifts. Additionally, to amplify the fractional treatment effect, bags are composed of instances with adjacent individual uplift predictions, instead of random instances. Experiments conducted on two datasets show the effectiveness and universality of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>short...</summary><p>short paper of CIKM22(full version)</p></details> |

However, with regard to gigapixel WSI classification problems, current MIL models are often incapable of differentiating a WSI with extremely small tumor lesions. This minute tumor-to-normal area ratio in a MIL bag inhibits the attention mechanism from properly weighting the areas corresponding to minor tumor lesions. To overcome this challenge, we propose salient instance inference MIL (SiiMIL), a weakly-supervised MIL model for WSI classification. Our method initially learns representations of normal WSIs, and it then compares the normal WSIs representations with all the input patches to infer the salient instances of the input WSI. Finally, it employs attention-based MIL to perform the slide-level classification based on the selected patches of the WSI. Our experiments imply that SiiMIL can accurately identify tumor instances, which could only take up less than 1% of a WSI, so that the ratio of tumor to normal instances within a bag can increase by two to four times. It is worth mentioning that it performs equally well for large tumor lesions. As a result, SiiMIL achieves a significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art MIL methods.</p></details> |  |

Due to the generic applicability, such methods are currently of very high interest in the research community, however, the issue of data augmentation in this context is rarely explored. Here we investigate linear and multilinear interpolation between feature vectors, a data augmentation technique, which proved to be capable of improving the generalization performance classification networks and also for multiple instance learning. Experiments, however, have been performed on only two rather small data sets and one specific feature extraction approach so far and a strong dependence on the data set has been identified. Here we conduct a large study incorporating 10 different data set configurations, two different feature extraction approaches (supervised and self-supervised), stain normalization and two multiple instance learning architectures. The results showed an extraordinarily high variability in the effect of the method. We identified several interesting aspects to bring light into the darkness and identified novel promising fields of research.</p></details> | <details><summary>for c...</summary><p>for code and data, see gitlab repo: https://gitlab.com/mgadermayr/mixupmil. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2211.05862</p></details> |

Particularly deep neural networks show high potential with respect to various tasks in the field of digital pathology. However, a limitation is given by the fact that typical deep learning algorithms require (manual) annotations in addition to the large amounts of image data, to enable effective training. Multiple instance learning exhibits a powerful tool for learning deep neural networks in a scenario without fully annotated data. These methods are particularly effective in this domain, due to the fact that labels for a complete whole slide image are often captured routinely, whereas labels for patches, regions or pixels are not. This potential already resulted in a considerable number of publications, with the majority published in the last three years. Besides the availability of data and a high motivation from the medical perspective, the availability of powerful graphics processing units exhibits an accelerator in this field. In this paper, we provide an overview of widely and effectively used concepts of used deep multiple instance learning approaches, recent advances and also critically discuss remaining challenges and future potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification: A Bag-Level Classifier is a Good Instance-Level Teacher](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01099v1)** | 2023-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has demonstrated promise in Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, a major challenge persists due to the high computational cost associated with processing these gigapixel images. Existing methods generally adopt a two-stage approach, comprising a non-learnable feature embedding stage and a classifier training stage. Though it can greatly reduce the memory consumption by using a fixed feature embedder pre-trained on other domains, such scheme also results in a disparity between the two stages, leading to suboptimal classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose that a bag-level classifier can be a good instance-level teacher. Based on this idea, we design Iteratively Coupled Multiple Instance Learning (ICMIL) to couple the embedder and the bag classifier at a low cost. ICMIL initially fix the patch embedder to train the bag classifier, followed by fixing the bag classifier to fine-tune the patch embedder. The refined embedder can then generate better representations in return, leading to a more accurate classifier for the next iteration. To realize more flexible and more effective embedder fine-tuning, we also introduce a teacher-student framework to efficiently distill the category knowledge in the bag classifier to help the instance-level embedder fine-tuning. Thorough experiments were conducted on four distinct datasets to validate the effectiveness of ICMIL. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of existing MIL backbones, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Due to the lack of patch-level labels, multiple instance learning (MIL) is a common practice for training a WSI classifier. One of the challenges in MIL for WSIs is the weak supervision coming only from the slide-level labels, often resulting in severe overfitting. In response, researchers have considered adopting patch-level augmentation or applying mixup augmentation, but their applicability remains unverified. Our approach augments the training dataset by sampling a subset of patches in the WSI without significantly altering the underlying semantics of the original slides. Additionally, we introduce an efficient model (Slot-MIL) that organizes patches into a fixed number of slots, the abstract representation of patches, using an attention mechanism. We empirically demonstrate that the subsampling augmentation helps to make more informative slots by restricting the over-concentration of attention and to improve interpretability. Finally, we illustrate that combining our attention-based aggregation model with subsampling and mixup, which has shown limited compatibility in existing MIL methods, can enhance both generalization and calibration. Our proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets including class imbalance and distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |

Calculating hypoxia levels can be an important step in understanding the biology of tumours, their clinical progression and response to treatment. This study demonstrates a novel application of deep learning to evaluate hypoxia in the context of breast cancer histomorphology. More precisely, we show that Weakly Supervised Deep Learning (WSDL) models can accurately detect hypoxia associated features in routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSI). We trained and evaluated a deep Multiple Instance Learning model on tiles from WSI H&E tissue from breast cancer primary sites (n=240) obtaining on average an AUC of 0.87 on a left-out test set. We also showed significant differences between features of hypoxic and normoxic tissue regions as distinguished by the WSDL models. Such DL hypoxia H&E WSI detection models could potentially be extended to other tumour types and easily integrated into the pathology workflow without requiring additional costly assays.</p></details> | Under review |

In doctors daily routine and computer-aided diagnosis, the Whole Slide Image (WSI) of histopathology tissue is used for analysis. Because of the extremely large scale of resolution, previous methods generally divide the WSI into a large number of patches, then aggregate all patches within a WSI by Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to make the slide-level prediction when developing computer-aided diagnosis tools. However, most previous WSI-MIL models using global-attention without pairwise interaction and any positional information, or self-attention with absolute position embedding can not well handle shape varying large WSIs, e.g. testing WSIs after model deployment may be larger than training WSIs, since the model development set is always limited due to the difficulty of histopathology WSIs collection. To deal with the problem, in this paper, we propose to amend position embedding for shape varying long-contextual WSI by introducing Linear Bias into Attention, and adapt it from 1-d long sequence into 2-d long-contextual WSI which helps model extrapolate position embedding to unseen or under-fitted positions. We further utilize Flash-Attention module to tackle the computational complexity of Transformer, which also keep full self-attention performance compared to previous attention approximation work. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (Long-MIL) are evaluated on extensive experiments including 4 dataset including WSI classification and survival prediction tasks to validate the superiority on shape varying WSIs.

WSIs require high magnifications to facilitate sub-cellular analysis. Precise annotations for patch- or even pixel-level classifications in the context of gigapixel WSIs are tedious to acquire and require domain experts. Coarse-grained labels, on the other hand, are easily accessible, which makes WSI classification an ideal use case for multiple instance learning (MIL). In our work, we propose a novel embedding-based Dual-Query MIL pipeline (DQ-MIL). We contribute to both the embedding and aggregation steps. Since all-purpose visual feature representations are not yet available, embedding models are currently limited in terms of generalizability. With our work, we explore the potential of dynamic meta-embedding based on cutting-edge self-supervised pre-trained models in the context of MIL. Moreover, we propose a new MIL architecture capable of combining MIL-attention with correlated self-attention. The Dual-Query Perceiver design of our approach allows us to leverage the concept of self-distillation and to combine the advantages of a small model in the context of a low data regime with the rich feature representation of a larger model. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on three histopathological datasets, where we show improvement of up to 10% over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

This operates in a task-agnostic manner and alleviates memory storage consumption, scaling to tasks with large-scale datasets.

Furthermore, anomaly events are rare and, as a consequence, class imbalance and lack of labeled anomaly data are also key features of this task. Therefore, weakly supervised methods are heavily researched for this application. In this paper, we tackle these typical problems of anomaly detection in surveillance video by combining Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to deal with the lack of labels and Multiple Camera Views (MC) to reduce occlusion and clutter effects. In the resulting MC-MIL algorithm we apply a multiple camera combined loss function to train a regression network with Sultani's MIL ranking function. To evaluate the MC-MIL algorithm first proposed here, the multiple camera PETS-2009 benchmark dataset was re-labeled for the anomaly detection task from multiple camera views. The result shows a significant performance improvement in F1 score compared to the single-camera configuration.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 4 Figures |

While significant efforts have been devoted to OOD detection in classical supervised settings, the context of weakly supervised learning, particularly the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework, remains under-explored. In this study, we tackle this challenge by adapting post-hoc OOD detection methods to the MIL setting while introducing a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess OOD detection performance in weakly supervised scenarios. Across extensive experiments based on diverse public datasets, KNN emerges as the best-performing method overall. However, it exhibits significant shortcomings on some datasets, emphasizing the complexity of this under-explored and challenging topic. Our findings shed light on the complex nature of OOD detection under the MIL framework, emphasizing the importance of developing novel, robust, and reliable methods that can generalize effectively in a weakly supervised context.

We propose an amplifier method for enhancing the performance of WSOD by integrating depth information. Our approach can be applied to any WSOD method based on multiple-instance learning, without necessitating additional annotations or inducing large computational expenses. Our proposed method employs a monocular depth estimation technique to obtain hallucinated depth information, which is then incorporated into a Siamese WSOD network using contrastive loss and fusion. By analyzing the relationship between language context and depth, we calculate depth priors to identify the bounding box proposals that may contain an object of interest. These depth priors are then utilized to update the list of pseudo ground-truth boxes, or adjust the confidence of per-box predictions. Our proposed method is evaluated on six datasets (COCO, PASCAL VOC, Conceptual Captions, Clipart1k, Watercolor2k, and Comic2k) by implementing it on top of two state-of-the-art WSOD methods, and we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation with Multi-class Label Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09319v2)** | 2023-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new active learning method for semantic segmentation. The core of our method lies in a new annotation query design. It samples informative local image regions (e.g., superpixels), and for each of such regions, asks an oracle for a multi-hot vector indicating all classes existing in the region. This multi-class labeling strategy is substantially more efficient than existing ones like segmentation, polygon, and even dominant class labeling in terms of annotation time per click. However, it introduces the class ambiguity issue in training as it assigns partial labels (i.e., a set of candidate classes) to individual pixels. We thus propose a new algorithm for learning semantic segmentation while disambiguating the partial labels in two stages. In the first stage, it trains a segmentation model directly with the partial labels through two new loss functions motivated by partial label learning and multiple instance learning. In the second stage, it disambiguates the partial labels by generating pixel-wise pseudo labels, which are used for supervised learning of the model. Equipped with a new acquisition function dedicated to the multi-class labeling, our method outperforms previous work on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 while spending less annotation cost.

| **[Pseudo-Bag Mixup Augmentation for Multiple Instance Learning-Based Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16180v3)** | 2023-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the special situation of modeling gigapixel images, multiple instance learning (MIL) has become one of the most important frameworks for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. In current practice, most MIL networks often face two unavoidable problems in training: i) insufficient WSI data and ii) the sample memorization inclination inherent in neural networks. These problems may hinder MIL models from adequate and efficient training, suppressing the continuous performance promotion of classification models on WSIs. Inspired by the basic idea of Mixup, this paper proposes a new Pseudo-bag Mixup (PseMix) data augmentation scheme to improve the training of MIL models. This scheme generalizes the Mixup strategy for general images to special WSIs via pseudo-bags so as to be applied in MIL-based WSI classification. Cooperated by pseudo-bags, our PseMix fulfills the critical size alignment and semantic alignment in Mixup strategy. Moreover, it is designed as an efficient and decoupled method, neither involving time-consuming operations nor relying on MIL model predictions. Comparative experiments and ablation studies are specially designed to evaluate the effectiveness and advantages of our PseMix. Experimental results show that PseMix could often assist state-of-the-art MIL networks to refresh their classification performance on WSIs. Besides, it could also boost the generalization performance of MIL models in special test scenarios, and promote their robustness to patch occlusion and label noise.

| **[Weakly-supervised Micro- and Macro-expression Spotting Based on Multi-level Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02734v2)** | 2023-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most micro- and macro-expression spotting methods in untrimmed videos suffer from the burden of video-wise collection and frame-wise annotation. Weakly-supervised expression spotting (WES) based on video-level labels can potentially mitigate the complexity of frame-level annotation while achieving fine-grained frame-level spotting. However, we argue that existing weakly-supervised methods are based on multiple instance learning (MIL) involving inter-modality, inter-sample, and inter-task gaps. The inter-sample gap is primarily from the sample distribution and duration. Therefore, we propose a novel and simple WES framework, MC-WES, using multi-consistency collaborative mechanisms that include modal-level saliency, video-level distribution, label-level duration and segment-level feature consistency strategies to implement fine frame-level spotting with only video-level labels to alleviate the above gaps and merge prior knowledge. The modal-level saliency consistency strategy focuses on capturing key correlations between raw images and optical flow. The video-level distribution consistency strategy utilizes the difference of sparsity in temporal distribution. The label-level duration consistency strategy exploits the difference in the duration of facial muscles. The segment-level feature consistency strategy emphasizes that features under the same labels maintain similarity. Experimental results on three challenging datasets -- CAS(ME)$^2$, CAS(ME)$^3$, and SAMM-LV -- demonstrate that MC-WES is comparable to state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Introducing instance label correlation in multiple instance learning. Application to cancer detection on histopathological images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19359v1)** | 2023-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last years, the weakly supervised paradigm of multiple instance learning (MIL) has become very popular in many different areas. A paradigmatic example is computational pathology, where the lack of patch-level labels for whole-slide images prevents the application of supervised models. Probabilistic MIL methods based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) have obtained promising results due to their excellent uncertainty estimation capabilities. However, these are general-purpose MIL methods that do not take into account one important fact: in (histopathological) images, the labels of neighboring patches are expected to be correlated. In this work, we extend a state-of-the-art GP-based MIL method, which is called VGPMIL-PR, to exploit such correlation. To do so, we develop a novel coupling term inspired by the statistical physics Ising model. We use variational inference to estimate all the model parameters. Interestingly, the VGPMIL-PR formulation is recovered when the weight that regulates the strength of the Ising term vanishes. The performance of the proposed method is assessed in two real-world problems of prostate cancer detection. We show that our model achieves better results than other state-of-the-art probabilistic MIL methods. We also provide different visualizations and analysis to gain insights into the influence of the novel Ising term. These insights are expected to facilitate the application of the proposed model to other research areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables.

| **[Reproducibility in Multiple Instance Learning: A Case For Algorithmic Unit Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17867v1)** | 2023-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a sub-domain of classification problems with positive and negative labels and a "bag" of inputs, where the label is positive if and only if a positive element is contained within the bag, and otherwise is negative. Training in this context requires associating the bag-wide label to instance-level information, and implicitly contains a causal assumption and asymmetry to the task (i.e., you can't swap the labels without changing the semantics). MIL problems occur in healthcare (one malignant cell indicates cancer), cyber security (one malicious executable makes an infected computer), and many other tasks. In this work, we examine five of the most prominent deep-MIL models and find that none of them respects the standard MIL assumption. They are able to learn anti-correlated instances, i.e., defaulting to "positive" labels until seeing a negative counter-example, which should not be possible for a correct MIL model. We suspect that enhancements and other works derived from these models will share the same issue. In any context in which these models are being used, this creates the potential for learning incorrect models, which creates risk of operational failure. We identify and demonstrate this problem via a proposed "algorithmic unit test", where we create synthetic datasets that can be solved by a MIL respecting model, and which clearly reveal learning that violates MIL assumptions. The five evaluated methods each fail one or more of these tests. This provides a model-agnostic way to identify violations of modeling assumptions, which we hope will be useful for future development and evaluation of MIL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

Rumors can trigger versatile, mostly controversial stance expressions among social media users. Rumor verification and stance detection are different yet relevant tasks. Fake news debunking primarily focuses on determining the truthfulness of news articles, which oversimplifies the issue as fake news often combines elements of both truth and falsehood. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify specific instances of misinformation within the articles. In this research, we investigate a novel task in the field of fake news debunking, which involves detecting sentence-level misinformation. One of the major challenges in this task is the absence of a training dataset with sentence-level annotations regarding veracity. Inspired by the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach, we propose a model called Weakly Supervised Detection of Misinforming Sentences (WSDMS). This model only requires bag-level labels for training but is capable of inferring both sentence-level misinformation and article-level veracity, aided by relevant social media conversations that are attentively contextualized with news sentences. We evaluate WSDMS on three real-world benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in debunking fake news at both the sentence and article levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Ovarian Cancer Treatment Response in Histopathology using Hierarchical Vision Transformers and Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12866v1)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For many patients, current ovarian cancer treatments offer limited clinical benefit. For some therapies, it is not possible to predict patients' responses, potentially exposing them to the adverse effects of treatment without any therapeutic benefit. As part of the automated prediction of treatment effectiveness in ovarian cancer using histopathological images (ATEC23) challenge, we evaluated the effectiveness of deep learning to predict whether a course of treatment including the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab could contribute to remission or prevent disease progression for at least 6 months in a set of 282 histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) from 78 ovarian cancer patients. Our approach used a pretrained Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer (HIPT) to extract region-level features and an attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) model to aggregate features and classify whole slides. The optimal HIPT-ABMIL model had an internal balanced accuracy of 60.2% +- 2.9% and an AUC of 0.646 +- 0.033. Histopathology-specific model pretraining was found to be beneficial to classification performance, though hierarchical transformers were not, with a ResNet feature extractor achieving similar performance. Due to the dataset being small and highly heterogeneous, performance was variable across 5-fold cross-validation folds, and there were some extreme differences between validation and test set performance within folds. The model did not generalise well to tissue microarrays, with accuracy worse than random chance. It is not yet clear whether ovarian cancer WSIs contain information that can be used to accurately predict treatment response, with further validation using larger, higher-quality datasets required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to ATEC23 challenge at MICCAI 2023 conference</p></details> |
| **[Mixing Histopathology Prototypes into Robust Slide-Level Representations for Cancer Subtyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12769v1)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image analysis via the means of computational pathology often relies on processing tessellated gigapixel images with only slide-level labels available. Applying multiple instance learning-based methods or transformer models is computationally expensive as, for each image, all instances have to be processed simultaneously. The MLP-Mixer is an under-explored alternative model to common vision transformers, especially for large-scale datasets. Due to the lack of a self-attention mechanism, they have linear computational complexity to the number of input patches but achieve comparable performance on natural image datasets. We propose a combination of feature embedding and clustering to preprocess the full whole-slide image into a reduced prototype representation which can then serve as input to a suitable MLP-Mixer architecture. Our experiments on two public benchmarks and one inhouse malignant lymphoma dataset show comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods, while achieving lower training costs in terms of computational time and memory load.

| **[Development and Validation of a Deep Learning-Based Microsatellite Instability Predictor from Prostate Cancer Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08743v1)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) is a tumor agnostic biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. However, MSI status is not routinely tested in prostate cancer, in part due to low prevalence and assay cost. As such, prediction of MSI status from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) could identify prostate cancer patients most likely to benefit from confirmatory testing and becoming eligible for immunotherapy. Prostate biopsies and surgical resections from de-identified records of consecutive prostate cancer patients referred to our institution were analyzed. Their MSI status was determined by next generation sequencing. Patients before a cutoff date were split into an algorithm development set (n=4015, MSI-H 1.8%) and a paired validation set (n=173, MSI-H 19.7%) that consisted of two serial sections from each sample, one stained and scanned internally and the other at an external site. Patients after the cutoff date formed the temporal validation set (n=1350, MSI-H 2.3%). Attention-based multiple instance learning models were trained to predict MSI-H from H&E WSIs. The MSI-H predictor achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.78 (95% CI [0.69-0.86]), 0.72 (95% CI [0.63-0.81]), and 0.72 (95% CI [0.62-0.82]) on the internally prepared, externally prepared, and temporal validation sets, respectively. While MSI-H status is significantly correlated with Gleason score, the model remained predictive within each Gleason score subgroup. In summary, we developed and validated an AI-based MSI-H diagnostic model on a large real-world cohort of routine H&E slides, which effectively generalized to externally stained and scanned samples and a temporally independent validation cohort. This algorithm has the potential to direct prostate cancer patients toward immunotherapy and to identify MSI-H cases secondary to Lynch syndrome.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Predicts Biomarker Status and Discovers Related Histomorphology Characteristics for Low-Grade Glioma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07464v1)** | 2023-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomarker detection is an indispensable part in the diagnosis and treatment of low-grade glioma (LGG). However, current LGG biomarker detection methods rely on expensive and complex molecular genetic testing, for which professionals are required to analyze the results, and intra-rater variability is often reported. To overcome these challenges, we propose an interpretable deep learning pipeline, a Multi-Biomarker Histomorphology Discoverer (Multi-Beholder) model based on the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, to predict the status of five biomarkers in LGG using only hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images and slide-level biomarker status labels. Specifically, by incorporating the one-class classification into the MIL framework, accurate instance pseudo-labeling is realized for instance-level supervision, which greatly complements the slide-level labels and improves the biomarker prediction performance. Multi-Beholder demonstrates superior prediction performance and generalizability for five LGG biomarkers (AUROC=0.6469-0.9735) in two cohorts (n=607) with diverse races and scanning protocols. Moreover, the excellent interpretability of Multi-Beholder allows for discovering the quantitative and qualitative correlations between biomarker status and histomorphology characteristics. Our pipeline not only provides a novel approach for biomarker prediction, enhancing the applicability of molecular treatments for LGG patients but also facilitates the discovery of new mechanisms in molecular functionality and LGG progression.</p></details> | 47 pages, 6 figures |

However, despite these achievements, the further enhancement of deep learning models for medical image analysis faces a significant challenge due to the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets. To address this issue, recent years have witnessed a growing emphasis on the development of data-efficient deep learning methods. This paper conducts a thorough review of data-efficient deep learning methods for medical image analysis. To this end, we categorize these methods based on the level of supervision they rely on, encompassing categories such as no supervision, inexact supervision, incomplete supervision, inaccurate supervision, and only limited supervision. We further divide these categories into finer subcategories. For example, we categorize inexact supervision into multiple instance learning and learning with weak annotations. Similarly, we categorize incomplete supervision into semi-supervised learning, active learning, and domain-adaptive learning and so on. Furthermore, we systematically summarize commonly used datasets for data efficient deep learning in medical image analysis and investigate future research directions to conclude this survey.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, their application in the field of pathology, particularly for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured medical texts such as pathology reports, remains underexplored and not well quantified. In this project, we leverage state-of-the-art language models, including the GPT family, Mistral models, and the open-source Llama models, to evaluate their performance in comprehensively analyzing pathology reports. Specifically, we assess their performance in cancer type identification, AJCC stage determination, and prognosis assessment, encompassing both information extraction and higher-order reasoning tasks. Based on a detailed analysis of their performance metrics in a zero-shot setting, we developed two instruction-tuned models: Path-llama3.1-8B and Path-GPT-4o-mini-FT. These models demonstrated superior performance in zero-shot cancer type identification, staging, and prognosis assessment compared to the other models evaluated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology Report Generation and Multimodal Representation Learning for Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19293v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of melanocytic skin lesions are examined by pathologists each year, the majority of which concern common nevi (i.e., ordinary moles). While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study. While report generation revealed to be more difficult for rare melanocytic lesion subtypes, the cross-modal retrieval performance for these cases was considerably better.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.19285</p></details> |

Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Leveraging large language models for structured information extraction from pathology reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12183v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Structured information extraction from unstructured histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research. Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to manual extraction by a trained human annotator. Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family, which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111 histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study, extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary. Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama 3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106, respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p <0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for self-hosting. Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for structured information extraction that can be customized by non-programmers using natural language. Its modular design enables reuse for various extraction tasks, producing standardized, structured data from unstructured text reports to facilitate analytics through improved accessibility and interoperability.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |

Pathology reports on these specimens convey treatment-relevant information. Beyond these reports, the diagnostic process generates extensive and complex information that is difficult to represent in reports, although it is of significant interest to the other medical specialties involved. 3D tissue reconstruction would allow for better spatial visualization, as well as combinations with other imaging modalities. Existing approaches in this area have proven labor-intensive and challenging to integrate into clinical workflows. 3D-SLIVER provides a simplified solution, implemented as an open-source 3DSlicer extension. We outline three specific real-world scenarios to illustrate its potential to improve transparency in diagnostic workflows and contribute to multi-modal research endeavors. Implementing the 3D reconstruction process involved four sub-modules of 3D-SLIVER: digitization of slicing protocol, virtual slicing of arbitrary 3D models based on that protocol, registration of slides with virtual slices using the Coherent Point Drift algorithm, and 3D reconstruction of registered information using convex hulls, Gaussian splatter and linear extrusion. Three use cases to employ 3D-SLIVER are presented: a low-effort approach to pathology workflow integration and two research-related use cases illustrating how to perform retrospective evaluations of PI-RADS predictions and statistically model 3D distributions of morphological patterns. 3D-SLIVER allows for improved interdisciplinary communication among specialties. It is designed for simplicity in application, allowing for flexible integration into various workflows and use cases. Here we focused on the clinical care of prostate cancer patients, but future possibilities are extensive with other neoplasms and in education and research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Whole Slide Foundation Model for Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19666v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

Recent approaches generally rely on weakly supervised learning due to the ease of acquiring case-level labels from pathology reports. However, patch-level classification is preferable in applications where only a limited number of cases are available or when local prediction accuracy is critical. On the other hand, acquiring extensive datasets with localized labels for training is not feasible. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised patch-level histopathological image classification model, named CLASS-M, that does not require extensively labeled datasets. CLASS-M is formed by two main parts: a contrastive learning module that uses separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images generated through an adaptive stain separation process, and a module with pseudo-labels using MixUp. We compare our model with other state-of-the-art models on two clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets. We demonstrate that our CLASS-M model has the best performance on both datasets.

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |

More specifically, it has altered the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process. The limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath can be overcome by FMs through learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision.

Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance. These approaches could be reliable enough for practical use in research workflows, highlighting the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare data extraction.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, these LLMs typically have billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for healthcare systems.Thus, in this study, we propose CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture, pre-trained on 2,676,642 clinical notes and 515,524 pathology reports covering 17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on three cancer-relevant tasks, including cancer phenotypes extraction, and cancer diagnosis generation. Our evaluation demonstrated that CancerLLM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other existing LLMs, with an average F1 score improvement of 7.61 %. Additionally, CancerLLM outperforms other models on two proposed robustness testbeds. This illustrates that CancerLLM can be effectively applied to clinical AI systems, enhancing clinical research and healthcare delivery in the field of cancer.</p></details> | <details><summary>add t...</summary><p>add the diagnosis evaluation of ICD code</p></details> |

The rise of multimodal large models has simplified the process of integrating image analysis with textual descriptions. Despite this advancement, the substantial costs associated with training and deploying these complex multimodal models, together with a scarcity of high-quality training datasets, create a significant divide between cutting-edge technology and its application in the clinical setting. We had meticulously compiled a dataset of approximately 45,000 cases, covering over 6 different tasks, including the classification of organ tissues, generating pathology report descriptions, and addressing pathology-related questions and answers. We have fine-tuned multimodal large models, specifically LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternLM, with this dataset to enhance instruction-based performance. We conducted a qualitative assessment of the capabilities of the base model and the fine-tuned model in performing image captioning and classification tasks on the specific dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits proficiency in addressing typical pathological questions. We hope that by making both our models and datasets publicly available, they can be valuable to the medical and research communities.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |
| **[PathAlign: A vision-language model for whole slide images in histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19578v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopic interpretation of histopathology images underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions. While advances in vision-language modeling raise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages and 19 pages of supplemental material; 3 main tables, 3 main figures and 11 supplemental tables, 7 supplemental figures</p></details> |

Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (PathText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues and achieve competitive performance on certain slide-level tasks. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our collected dataset and related code are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Use of natural language processing to extract and classify papillary thyroid cancer features from surgical pathology reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00015v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background We aim to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction and classification of thyroid cancer risk factors from pathology reports. Methods We analyzed 1,410 surgical pathology reports from adult papillary thyroid cancer patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from 2010 to 2019. Structured and non-structured reports were used to create a consensus-based ground truth dictionary and categorized them into modified recurrence risk levels. Non-structured reports were narrative, while structured reports followed standardized formats. We then developed ThyroPath, a rule-based NLP pipeline, to extract and classify thyroid cancer features into risk categories. Training involved 225 reports (150 structured, 75 unstructured), with testing on 170 reports (120 structured, 50 unstructured) for evaluation. The pipeline's performance was assessed using both strict and lenient criteria for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results In extraction tasks, ThyroPath achieved overall strict F-1 scores of 93% for structured reports and 90 for unstructured reports, covering 18 thyroid cancer pathology features. In classification tasks, ThyroPath-extracted information demonstrated an overall accuracy of 93% in categorizing reports based on their corresponding guideline-based risk of recurrence: 76.9% for high-risk, 86.8% for intermediate risk, and 100% for both low and very low-risk cases. However, ThyroPath achieved 100% accuracy across all thyroid cancer risk categories with human-extracted pathology information. Conclusions ThyroPath shows promise in automating the extraction and risk recurrence classification of thyroid pathology reports at large scale. It offers a solution to laborious manual reviews and advancing virtual registries. However, it requires further validation before implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Large Multimodal Model based Standardisation of Pathology Reports with Confidence and their Prognostic Significance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02040v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology reports are rich in clinical and pathological details but are often presented in free-text format. The unstructured nature of these reports presents a significant challenge limiting the accessibility of their content. In this work, we present a practical approach based on the use of large multimodal models (LMMs) for automatically extracting information from scanned images of pathology reports with the goal of generating a standardised report specifying the value of different fields along with estimated confidence about the accuracy of the extracted fields. The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods which do not assign confidence scores to extracted fields limiting their practical use. The proposed framework uses two stages of prompting a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for information extraction and validation. The framework generalises to textual reports from multiple medical centres as well as scanned images of legacy pathology reports. We show that the estimated confidence is an effective indicator of the accuracy of the extracted information that can be used to select only accurately extracted fields. We also show the prognostic significance of structured and unstructured data from pathology reports and show that the automatically extracted field values significant prognostic value for patient stratification. The framework is available for evaluation via the URL: https://labieb.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Beyond Self-Consistency: Ensemble Reasoning Boosts Consistency and Accuracy of LLMs in Cancer Staging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13149v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) have encouraged their adoption in the healthcare domain where vital clinical information is often contained in unstructured notes. Cancer staging status is available in clinical reports, but it requires natural language processing to extract the status from the unstructured text. With the advance in clinical-oriented LLMs, it is promising to extract such status without extensive efforts in training the algorithms. Prompting approaches of the pre-trained LLMs that elicit a model's reasoning process, such as chain-of-thought, may help to improve the trustworthiness of the generated responses. Using self-consistency further improves model performance, but often results in inconsistent generations across the multiple reasoning paths. In this study, we propose an ensemble reasoning approach with the aim of improving the consistency of the model generations. Using an open access clinical large language model to determine the pathologic cancer stage from real-world pathology reports, we show that the ensemble reasoning approach is able to improve both the consistency and performance of the LLM in determining cancer stage, thereby demonstrating the potential to use these models in clinical or other domains where reliability and trustworthiness are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME'24)</p></details> |

In order to reduce the number of positive margins would offer surgeon real-time intra-operative information on the presence of positive resection margins. This study aims to design an intra-operative tumour margin evaluation scheme by using specimen mammography in breast-conserving surgery. Total of 30 cases were evaluated and compared with the manually determined contours by experienced physicians and pathology report. The proposed method utilizes image thresholding to extract regions of interest and then performs a deep learning model, i.e. SegNet, to segment tumour tissue. The margin width of normal tissues surrounding it is evaluated as the result. The desired size of margin around the tumor was set for 10 mm. The smallest average difference to manual sketched margin (6.53 mm +- 5.84). In the all case, the SegNet architecture was utilized to obtain tissue specimen boundary and tumor contour, respectively. The simulation results indicated that this technology is helpful in discriminating positive from negative margins in the intra-operative setting. The aim of proposed scheme was a potential procedure in the intra-operative measurement system. The experimental results reveal that deep learning techniques can draw results that are consistent with pathology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 pag...</summary><p>1 pages, 6 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Classifying Cancer Stage with Open-Source Clinical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01589v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer stage classification is important for making treatment and care management plans for oncology patients. Information on staging is often included in unstructured form in clinical, pathology, radiology and other free-text reports in the electronic health record system, requiring extensive work to parse and obtain. To facilitate the extraction of this information, previous NLP approaches rely on labeled training datasets, which are labor-intensive to prepare. In this study, we demonstrate that without any labeled training data, open-source clinical large language models (LLMs) can extract pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) staging information from real-world pathology reports. Our experiments compare LLMs and a BERT-based model fine-tuned using the labeled data. Our findings suggest that while LLMs still exhibit subpar performance in Tumor (T) classification, with the appropriate adoption of prompting strategies, they can achieve comparable performance on Metastasis (M) classification and improved performance on Node (N) classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (IEEE ICHI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[A comparative study of zero-shot inference with large language models and supervised modeling in breast cancer pathology classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13887v1)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although supervised machine learning is popular for information extraction from clinical notes, creating large annotated datasets requires extensive domain expertise and is time-consuming. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising transfer learning capability. In this study, we explored whether recent LLMs can reduce the need for large-scale data annotations. We curated a manually-labeled dataset of 769 breast cancer pathology reports, labeled with 13 categories, to compare zero-shot classification capability of the GPT-4 model and the GPT-3.5 model with supervised classification performance of three model architectures: random forests classifier, long short-term memory networks with attention (LSTM-Att), and the UCSF-BERT model. Across all 13 tasks, the GPT-4 model performed either significantly better than or as well as the best supervised model, the LSTM-Att model (average macro F1 score of 0.83 vs. 0.75). On tasks with high imbalance between labels, the differences were more prominent. Frequent sources of GPT-4 errors included inferences from multiple samples and complex task design. On complex tasks where large annotated datasets cannot be easily collected, LLMs can reduce the burden of large-scale data labeling. However, if the use of LLMs is prohibitive, the use of simpler supervised models with large annotated datasets can provide comparable results. LLMs demonstrated the potential to speed up the execution of clinical NLP studies by reducing the need for curating large annotated datasets. This may result in an increase in the utilization of NLP-based variables and outcomes in observational clinical studies.</p></details> |  |

Thus, such system can reduce the burden for populating tumor registries, help registration for clinical trial as well as developing large dataset for deep learning model development using true pathologic ground truth. However, the content of breast pathology reports can be difficult for categorize due to the high linguistic variability in content and wide variety of potential diagnoses >50. Existing NLP models are primarily focused on developing classifier for primary breast cancer types (e.g. IDC, DCIS, ILC) and tumor characteristics, and ignore the rare diagnosis of cancer subtypes. We then developed a hierarchical hybrid transformer-based pipeline (59 labels) - Hierarchical Classification System for Breast Cancer Specimen Report (HCSBC), which utilizes the potential of the transformer context-preserving NLP technique and compared our model to several state of the art ML and DL models. We trained the model on the EUH data and evaluated our model's performance on two external datasets - MGH and Mayo Clinic. We publicly release the code and a live application under Huggingface spaces repository</p></details> |  |

The four subtypes are Luminal A (LA), Luminal B (LB), HER2 subtype, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Immunohistochemistry is the gold-standard evaluation, although interobserver variations are reported and molecular signatures identification is time-consuming. Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy with machine learning approaches have been used to evaluate cancer samples, presenting biochemical-related explainability. However, this explainability is harder when using deep learning. This study created a 1D deep learning tool for breast cancer subtype evaluation and biochemical contribution. Sixty hyperspectral images were acquired from a human breast cancer microarray. K-Means clustering was applied to select tissue and paraffin spectra. CaReNet-V1, a novel 1D convolutional neural network, was developed to classify breast cancer (CA) and adjacent tissue (AT), and molecular subtypes. A 1D adaptation of Grad-CAM was applied to assess the biochemical impact to the classifications. CaReNet-V1 effectively classified CA and AT (test accuracy of 0.89), as well as HER2 and TNBC subtypes (0.83 and 0.86), with greater difficulty for LA and LB (0.74 and 0.68). The model enabled the evaluation of the most contributing wavenumbers to the predictions, providing a direct relationship with the biochemical content. Therefore, CaReNet-V1 and hyperspectral images is a potential approach for breast cancer biopsies assessment, providing additional information to the pathology report. Biochemical content impact feature may be used for other studies, such as treatment efficacy evaluation and development new diagnostics and therapeutic methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Laborious manual chart review is required to extract key diagnostic phenotypes from BE pathology reports. We developed a generalizable transformer-based method to automate data extraction. Using pathology reports from Columbia University Irving Medical Center with gastroenterologist-annotated targets, we performed binary dysplasia classification as well as granularized multi-class BE-related diagnosis classification. We utilized two clinically pre-trained large language models, with best model performance comparable to a highly tailored rule-based system developed using the same data. Binary dysplasia extraction achieves 0.964 F1-score, while the multi-class model achieves 0.911 F1-score. Our method is generalizable and faster to implement as compared to a tailored rule-based approach.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the authors demonstrate their approach by extracting structured condition codes from pathology reports. The proposed approach utilizes local LLMs, which can be fine-tuned to respond to specific generative instructions and provide structured outputs. The authors collected a dataset of over 150k uncurated surgical pathology reports, containing gross descriptions, final diagnoses, and condition codes. They trained different model architectures, including LLaMA, BERT and LongFormer and evaluated their performance. The results show that the LLaMA-based models significantly outperform BERT-style models across all evaluated metrics, even with extremely reduced precision. The LLaMA models performed especially well with large datasets, demonstrating their ability to handle complex, multi-label tasks. Overall, this work presents an effective approach for utilizing LLMs to perform domain-specific tasks using accessible hardware, with potential applications in the medical domain, where complex data extraction and classification are required.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, Preprint of an article submitted for consideration in Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing \c{opyright} 2024 copyright World Scientific Publishing Company https://www.worldscientific.com/</p></details> |
| **[Validation of a Zero-Shot Learning Natural Language Processing Tool for Data Abstraction from Unstructured Healthcare Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00107v1)** | 2023-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objectives: To describe the development and validation of a zero-shot learning natural language processing (NLP) tool for abstracting data from unstructured text contained within PDF documents, such as those found within electronic health records. Materials and Methods: A data abstraction tool based on the GPT-3.5 model from OpenAI was developed and compared to three physician human abstractors in terms of time to task completion and accuracy for abstracting data on 14 unique variables from a set of 199 de-identified radical prostatectomy pathology reports. The reports were processed by the software tool in vectorized and scanned formats to establish the impact of optical character recognition on data abstraction. The tool was assessed for superiority for data abstraction speed and non-inferiority for accuracy. Results: The human abstractors required a mean of 101s per report for data abstraction, with times varying from 15 to 284 s. In comparison, the software tool required a mean of 12.8 s to process the vectorized reports and a mean of 15.8 to process the scanned reports (P < 0.001). The overall accuracies of the three human abstractors were 94.7%, 97.8%, and 96.4% for the combined set of 2786 datapoints. The software tool had an overall accuracy of 94.2% for the vectorized reports, proving to be non-inferior to the human abstractors at a margin of -10% ($\alpha$=0.025). The tool had a slightly lower accuracy of 88.7% using the scanned reports, proving to be non-inferiority to 2 out of 3 human abstractors. Conclusion: The developed zero-shot learning NLP tool affords researchers comparable levels of accuracy to that of human abstractors, with significant time savings benefits. Because of the lack of need for task-specific model training, the developed tool is highly generalizable and can be used for a wide variety of data abstraction tasks, even outside the field of medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 3 supplementary figures</p></details> |

However, existing works typically train on large datasets of image-text pairs and have been designed to perform downstream tasks involving only small to medium sized-images, neither of which are applicable to the emerging field of computational pathology where there are limited publicly available paired image-text datasets and each image can span up to 100,000 x 100,000 pixels. In this paper we present MI-Zero, a simple and intuitive framework for unleashing the zero-shot transfer capabilities of contrastively aligned image and text models on gigapixel histopathology whole slide images, enabling multiple downstream diagnostic tasks to be carried out by pretrained encoders without requiring any additional labels. MI-Zero reformulates zero-shot transfer under the framework of multiple instance learning to overcome the computational challenge of inference on extremely large images. We used over 550k pathology reports and other available in-domain text corpora to pre-train our text encoder. By effectively leveraging strong pre-trained encoders, our best model pretrained on over 33k histopathology image-caption pairs achieves an average median zero-shot accuracy of 70.2% across three different real-world cancer subtyping tasks.

The aim of this study is to propose a novel methodology to assist physicians in their decision-making. Methods: A retrospective study between 2012 and 2020 with 333 cases that underwent an ODX assay from three hospitals in Bourgogne Franche-Comt{\'e} was conducted. Clinical and pathological reports were used to collect the data. A methodology based on distributional random forest was developed using 9 clinico-pathological characteristics. This methodology can be used particularly to identify the patients of the training cohort that share similarities with the new patient and to predict an estimate of the distribution of the ODX score. Results: The mean age of participants id 56.9 years old. We have correctly classified 92% of patients in low risk and 40.2% of patients in high risk. The overall accuracy is 79.3%. The proportion of low risk correct predicted value (PPV) is 82%. The percentage of high risk correct predicted value (NPV) is approximately 62.3%. The F1-score and the Area Under Curve (AUC) are of 0.87 and 0.759, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed methodology makes it possible to predict the distribution of the ODX score for a patient and provides an explanation of the predicted score. The use of the methodology with the pathologist's expertise on the different histological and immunohistochemical characteristics has a clinical impact to help oncologist in decision-making regarding breast cancer therapy.</p></details> |  |

Improving the characterization of precancerous adenomas assists in developing diagnostic tests for early cancer detection and prevention, especially for colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we developed transformer-based deep neural network NLP models to perform the CRC phenotyping, with the goal of extracting precancerous lesion attributes and distinguishing cancer and precancerous cases. We achieved 0.914 macro-F1 scores for classifying patients into negative, non-advanced adenoma, advanced adenoma and CRC. We further improved the performance to 0.923 using an ensemble of classifiers for cancer status classification and lesion size named entity recognition (NER). Our results demonstrated the potential of using NLP to leverage real-world health record data to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests for early cancer prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimorbidity Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval Using Proxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12185v1)** | 2022-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content-based medical image retrieval is an important diagnostic tool that improves the explainability of computer-aided diagnosis systems and provides decision making support to healthcare professionals. Medical imaging data, such as radiology images, are often multimorbidity; a single sample may have more than one pathology present. As such, image retrieval systems for the medical domain must be designed for the multi-label scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label metric learning method that can be used for both classification and content-based image retrieval. In this way, our model is able to support diagnosis by predicting the presence of diseases and provide evidence for these predictions by returning samples with similar pathological content to the user. In practice, the retrieved images may also be accompanied by pathology reports, further assisting in the diagnostic process. Our method leverages proxy feature vectors, enabling the efficient learning of a robust feature space in which the distance between feature vectors can be used as a measure of the similarity of those samples. Unlike existing proxy-based methods, training samples are able to assign to multiple proxies that span multiple class labels. This multi-label proxy assignment results in a feature space that encodes the complex relationships between diseases present in medical imaging data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art image retrieval systems and a set of baseline approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach to both classification and content-based image retrieval on two multimorbidity radiology datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Objective and Reproducible Osteosarcoma Chemotherapy Response Assessment and Outcome Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04910v1)** | 2022-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer whose standard treatment includes pre-operative chemotherapy followed by resection. Chemotherapy response is used for predicting prognosis and further management of patients. Necrosis is routinely assessed post-chemotherapy from histology slides on resection specimens where necrosis ratio is defined as the ratio of necrotic tumor to overall tumor. Patients with necrosis ratio >=90% are known to have better outcome. Manual microscopic review of necrosis ratio from multiple glass slides is semi-quantitative and can have intra- and inter-observer variability. We propose an objective and reproducible deep learning-based approach to estimate necrosis ratio with outcome prediction from scanned hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images. We collected 103 osteosarcoma cases with 3134 WSIs to train our deep learning model, to validate necrosis ratio assessment, and to evaluate outcome prediction. We trained Deep Multi-Magnification Network to segment multiple tissue subtypes including viable tumor and necrotic tumor in pixel-level and to calculate case-level necrosis ratio from multiple WSIs. We showed necrosis ratio estimated by our segmentation model highly correlates with necrosis ratio from pathology reports manually assessed by experts where mean absolute differences for Grades IV (100%), III (>=90%), and II (>=50% and <90%) necrosis response are 4.4%, 4.5%, and 17.8%, respectively. We successfully stratified patients to predict overall survival with p=10^-6 and progression-free survival with p=0.012. Our reproducible approach without variability enabled us to tune cutoff thresholds, specifically for our model and our data set, to 80% for OS and 60% for PFS. Our study indicates deep learning can support pathologists as an objective tool to analyze osteosarcoma from histology for assessing treatment response and predicting patient outcome.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multistep Automated Data Labelling Procedure (MADLaP) for Thyroid Nodules on Ultrasound: An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Automating Image Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14305v1)** | 2022-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) for diagnosis of thyroid nodules on ultrasound is an active area of research. However, ML tools require large, well-labelled datasets, the curation of which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The purpose of our study was to develop and test a deep-learning-based tool to facilitate and automate the data annotation process for thyroid nodules; we named our tool Multistep Automated Data Labelling Procedure (MADLaP). MADLaP was designed to take multiple inputs included pathology reports, ultrasound images, and radiology reports. Using multiple step-wise modules including rule-based natural language processing, deep-learning-based imaging segmentation, and optical character recognition, MADLaP automatically identified images of a specific thyroid nodule and correctly assigned a pathology label. The model was developed using a training set of 378 patients across our health system and tested on a separate set of 93 patients. Ground truths for both sets were selected by an experienced radiologist. Performance metrics including yield (how many labeled images the model produced) and accuracy (percentage correct) were measured using the test set. MADLaP achieved a yield of 63% and an accuracy of 83%. The yield progressively increased as the input data moved through each module, while accuracy peaked part way through. Error analysis showed that inputs from certain examination sites had lower accuracy (40%) than the other sites (90%, 100%). MADLaP successfully created curated datasets of labeled ultrasound images of thyroid nodules. While accurate, the relatively suboptimal yield of MADLaP exposed some challenges when trying to automatically label radiology images from heterogeneous sources. The complex task of image curation and annotation could be automated, allowing for enrichment of larger datasets for use in machine learning development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why I'm not Answering: Understanding Determinants of Classification of an Abstaining Classifier for Cancer Pathology Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05094v5)** | 2022-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe deployment of deep learning systems in critical real world applications requires models to make very few mistakes, and only under predictable circumstances. In this work, we address this problem using an abstaining classifier that is tuned to have $>$95% accuracy, and then identify the determinants of abstention using LIME. Essentially, we are training our model to learn the attributes of pathology reports that are likely to lead to incorrect classifications, albeit at the cost of reduced sensitivity. We demonstrate an abstaining classifier in a multitask setting for classifying cancer pathology reports from the NCI SEER cancer registries on six tasks of interest. For these tasks, we reduce the classification error rate by factors of 2--5 by abstaining on 25--45% of the reports. For the specific task of classifying cancer site, we are able to identify metastasis, reports involving lymph nodes, and discussion of multiple cancer sites as responsible for many of the classification mistakes, and observe that the extent and types of mistakes vary systematically with cancer site (e.g., breast, lung, and prostate). When combining across three of the tasks, our model classifies 50% of the reports with an accuracy greater than 95% for three of the six tasks\edit, and greater than 85% for all six tasks on the retained samples. Furthermore, we show that LIME provides a better determinant of classification than measures of word occurrence alone. By combining a deep abstaining classifier with feature identification using LIME, we are able to identify concepts responsible for both correctness and abstention when classifying cancer sites from pathology reports. The improvement of LIME over keyword searches is statistically significant, presumably because words are assessed in context and have been identified as a local determinant of classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[CancerBERT: a BERT model for Extracting Breast Cancer Phenotypes from Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11303v2)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extraction of breast cancer patients' phenotypes is important for clinical decision support and clinical research. Current models do not take full advantage of cancer domain-specific corpus, whether pre-training Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer model on cancer-specific corpus could improve the performances of extracting breast cancer phenotypes from texts data remains to be explored. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the CancerBERT model for extracting breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts in electronic health records. This data used in the study included 21,291 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2020, patients' clinical notes and pathology reports were collected from the University of Minnesota Clinical Data Repository (UMN). Results: About 3 million clinical notes and pathology reports in electronic health records for 21,291 breast cancer patients were collected to train the CancerBERT model. 200 pathology reports and 50 clinical notes of breast cancer patients that contain 9,685 sentences and 221,356 tokens were manually annotated by two annotators. 20% of the annotated data was used as a test set. Our CancerBERT model achieved the best performance with macro F1 scores equal to 0.876 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for exact match and 0.904 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for the lenient match. The NER models we developed would facilitate the automated information extraction from clinical texts to further help clinical decision support. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, we focused on the breast cancer-related concepts extraction from EHR data and obtained a comprehensive annotated dataset that contains 7 types of breast cancer-related concepts. The CancerBERT model with customized vocabulary could significantly improve the performance for extracting breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural language processing to identify lupus nephritis phenotype in electronic health records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10821v1)** | 2021-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by an unpredictable course of flares and remission with diverse manifestations. Lupus nephritis, one of the major disease manifestations of SLE for organ damage and mortality, is a key component of lupus classification criteria. Accurately identifying lupus nephritis in electronic health records (EHRs) would therefore benefit large cohort observational studies and clinical trials where characterization of the patient population is critical for recruitment, study design, and analysis. Lupus nephritis can be recognized through procedure codes and structured data, such as laboratory tests. However, other critical information documenting lupus nephritis, such as histologic reports from kidney biopsies and prior medical history narratives, require sophisticated text processing to mine information from pathology reports and clinical notes. In this study, we developed algorithms to identify lupus nephritis with and without natural language processing (NLP) using EHR data. We developed four algorithms: a rule-based algorithm using only structured data (baseline algorithm) and three algorithms using different NLP models. The three NLP models are based on regularized logistic regression and use different sets of features including positive mention of concept unique identifiers (CUIs), number of appearances of CUIs, and a mixture of three components respectively. The baseline algorithm and the best performed NLP algorithm were external validated on a dataset from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Our best performing NLP model incorporating features from both structured data, regular expression concepts, and mapped CUIs improved F measure in both the NMEDW (0.41 vs 0.79) and VUMC (0.62 vs 0.96) datasets compared to the baseline lupus nephritis algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gram Barcodes for Histopathology Tissue Texture Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15519v1)** | 2021-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in digital pathology have led to the need for Histopathology Image Retrieval (HIR) systems that search through databases of biopsy images to find similar cases to a given query image. These HIR systems allow pathologists to effortlessly and efficiently access thousands of previously diagnosed cases in order to exploit the knowledge in the corresponding pathology reports. Since HIR systems may have to deal with millions of gigapixel images, the extraction of compact and expressive image features must be available to allow for efficient and accurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the application of Gram barcodes as image features for HIR systems. Unlike most feature generation schemes, Gram barcodes are based on high-order statistics that describe tissue texture by summarizing the correlations between different feature maps in layers of convolutional neural networks. We run HIR experiments on three public datasets using a pre-trained VGG19 network for Gram barcode generation and showcase highly competitive results.</p></details> |  |

An essential step in constructing large-scale MKG is extracting information from medical reports. Recently, information extraction techniques have been proposed and show promising performance in biomedical information extraction. However, these methods only consider limited types of entity and relation due to the noisy biomedical text data with complex entity correlations. Thus, they fail to provide enough information for constructing MKGs and restrict the downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose Biomedical Information Extraction, a hybrid neural network to extract relations from biomedical text and unstructured medical reports. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention enhanced graph convolutional network to capture the complex relations and context information while resisting the noise from the data. We evaluate our model on two major biomedical relationship extraction tasks, chemical-disease relation and chemical-protein interaction, and a cross-hospital pan-cancer pathology report corpus. The results show that our method achieves superior performance than baselines. Furthermore, we evaluate the applicability of our method under a transfer learning setting and show that BioIE achieves promising performance in processing medical text from different formats and writing styles.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2021 accepted, including 9 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

This lead to the current generalized standards that are being continuously updated as new findings are reported. It is noticeable that these effective standards are developed based on a multi-source heterogeneous data, including whole-slide images and pathology and clinical reports. In this study, we propose a framework that combines pathological images and medical reports to generate a personalized diagnosis result for individual patient. We use nuclei-level image feature similarity and content-based deep learning method to search for a personalized group of population with similar pathological characteristics, extract structured prognostic information from descriptive pathology reports of the similar patient population, and assign importance of different prognostic factors to generate a personalized pathological diagnosis result. We use multi-source heterogeneous data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. The result demonstrate that our framework matches the performance of pathologists in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. This framework is designed to be generic, thus could be applied for other types of cancer. The weights could provide insights to the known prognostic factors and further guide more precise clinical treatment protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2021 accepted, including 9 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Extracting details of the colonoscopy findings from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to determine patient risk for CRC and colorectal screening strategies. We developed and evaluated the accuracy of a deep learning model framework to extract information for the clinical decision support system to interpret relevant free-text reports, including indications, pathology, and findings notes. The Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF framework was developed using Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to extract several clinical features from these free-text reports including indications for the colonoscopy, findings during the colonoscopy, and pathology of resected material. We trained the Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF and existing Bi-LSTM-CRF models on 80% of 4,000 manually annotated notes from 3,867 patients. These clinical notes were from a group of patients over 40 years of age enrolled in four Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. A total of 10% of the remaining annotated notes were used to train hyperparameter and the remaining 10% were used to evaluate the accuracy of our model Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF and compare to Bi-LSTM-CRF.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Integration of Domain Knowledge using Medical Knowledge Graph Deep Learning for Cancer Phenotyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01337v1)** | 2021-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key component of deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) is word embeddings. Word embeddings that effectively capture the meaning and context of the word that they represent can significantly improve the performance of downstream DL models for various NLP tasks. Many existing word embeddings techniques capture the context of words based on word co-occurrence in documents and text; however, they often cannot capture broader domain-specific relationships between concepts that may be crucial for the NLP task at hand. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate external knowledge from medical terminology ontologies into the context captured by word embeddings. Specifically, we use a medical knowledge graph, such as the unified medical language system (UMLS), to find connections between clinical terms in cancer pathology reports. This approach aims to minimize the distance between connected clinical concepts. We evaluate the proposed approach using a Multitask Convolutional Neural Network (MT-CNN) to extract six cancer characteristics -- site, subsite, laterality, behavior, histology, and grade -- from a dataset of ~900K cancer pathology reports. The results show that the MT-CNN model which uses our domain informed embeddings outperforms the same MT-CNN using standard word2vec embeddings across all tasks, with an improvement in the overall micro- and macro-F1 scores by 4.97\%and 22.5\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enriched Annotations for Tumor Attribute Classification from Pathology Reports with Limited Labeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08113v1)** | 2020-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision medicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, but much of the data for patients is locked away in unstructured free-text, limiting research and delivery of effective personalized treatments. Generating large annotated datasets for information extraction from clinical notes is often challenging and expensive due to the high level of expertise needed for high quality annotations. To enable natural language processing for small dataset sizes, we develop a novel enriched hierarchical annotation scheme and algorithm, Supervised Line Attention (SLA), and apply this algorithm to predicting categorical tumor attributes from kidney and colon cancer pathology reports from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Whereas previous work only annotated document level labels, we in addition ask the annotators to enrich the traditional label by asking them to also highlight the relevant line or potentially lines for the final label, which leads to a 20% increase of annotation time required per document. With the enriched annotations, we develop a simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm that first predicts the relevant lines in the document and then predicts the tumor attribute. Our results show across the small dataset sizes of 32, 64, 128, and 186 labeled documents per cancer, SLA only requires half the number of labeled documents as state-of-the-art methods to achieve similar or better micro-f1 and macro-f1 scores for the vast majority of comparisons that we made. Accounting for the increased annotation time, this leads to a 40% reduction in total annotation time over the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality with A.I.-based Gleason Grading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05197v1)** | 2020-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gleason grading of prostate cancer is an important prognostic factor but suffers from poor reproducibility, particularly among non-subspecialist pathologists. Although artificial intelligence (A.I.) tools have demonstrated Gleason grading on-par with expert pathologists, it remains an open question whether A.I. grading translates to better prognostication. In this study, we developed a system to predict prostate-cancer specific mortality via A.I.-based Gleason grading and subsequently evaluated its ability to risk-stratify patients on an independent retrospective cohort of 2,807 prostatectomy cases from a single European center with 5-25 years of follow-up (median: 13, interquartile range 9-17). The A.I.'s risk scores produced a C-index of 0.84 (95%CI 0.80-0.87) for prostate cancer-specific mortality. Upon discretizing these risk scores into risk groups analogous to pathologist Grade Groups (GG), the A.I. had a C-index of 0.82 (95%CI 0.78-0.85). On the subset of cases with a GG in the original pathology report (n=1,517), the A.I.'s C-indices were 0.87 and 0.85 for continuous and discrete grading, respectively, compared to 0.79 (95%CI 0.71-0.86) for GG obtained from the reports. These represent improvements of 0.08 (95%CI 0.01-0.15) and 0.07 (95%CI 0.00-0.14) respectively. Our results suggest that A.I.-based Gleason grading can lead to effective risk-stratification and warrants further evaluation for improving disease management.</p></details> |  |

Unstructured pathology reports, which contain tumor specific data, are the main source of information collected by cancer registries. Due to manual processing and labelling of pathology reports using the International Classification of Disease for oncology (ICD-O) codes, by human coders employed by cancer registries, has led to a considerable lag in cancer reporting. We present a hierarchical deep learning classification method that employs convolutional neural network models to automate the classification of 1813 anonymized breast cancer pathology reports with applicable ICD-O morphology codes across 9 classes.

The annotation is extensive for the large volume of cancer pathology reports the registry receives annually from public and private sector institutions. This manual process, coupled with other challenges results in a significant 4-year lag in reporting of annual cancer statistics in South Africa. We present a hierarchical deep learning ensemble method incorporating state of the art convolutional neural network models for the automatic labelling of 2201 de-identified, free text pathology reports, with appropriate ICD-O breast cancer topography codes across 8 classes. Our results show an improvement in primary site classification over the state of the art CNN model by greater than 14% for F1 micro and 55% for F1 macro scores. We demonstrate that the hierarchical deep learning ensemble improves on state-of-the-art models for ICD-O topography classification in comparison to a flat multiclass model for predicting ICD-O topography codes for pathology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD workshop on Machine Learning for Medicine and Healthcare, August 2018, London UK</p></details> |
| **[Model Reduction of Shallow CNN Model for Reliable Deployment of Information Extraction from Medical Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01572v1)** | 2020-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is a time-tested tool for the information extraction from cancer pathology reports. Shallow CNN performs competitively on this task to other deep learning models including BERT, which holds the state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks. The main insight behind this eccentric phenomenon is that the information extraction from cancer pathology reports require only a small number of domain-specific text segments to perform the task, thus making the most of the texts and contexts excessive for the task. Shallow CNN model is well-suited to identify these key short text segments from the labeled training set; however, the identified text segments remain obscure to humans. In this study, we fill this gap by developing a model reduction tool to make a reliable connection between CNN filters and relevant text segments by discarding the spurious connections. We reduce the complexity of shallow CNN representation by approximating it with a linear transformation of n-gram presence representation with a non-negativity and sparsity prior on the transformation weights to obtain an interpretable model. Our approach bridge the gap between the conventionally perceived trade-off boundary between accuracy on the one side and explainability on the other by model reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide-and-Rule: Self-Supervised Learning for Survival Analysis in Colorectal Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03292v1)** | 2020-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the long-term rapid increase in incidences of colorectal cancer (CRC), there is an urgent clinical need to improve risk stratification. The conventional pathology report is usually limited to only a few histopathological features. However, most of the tumor microenvironments used to describe patterns of aggressive tumor behavior are ignored. In this work, we aim to learn histopathological patterns within cancerous tissue regions that can be used to improve prognostic stratification for colorectal cancer. To do so, we propose a self-supervised learning method that jointly learns a representation of tissue regions as well as a metric of the clustering to obtain their underlying patterns. These histopathological patterns are then used to represent the interaction between complex tissues and predict clinical outcomes directly. We furthermore show that the proposed approach can benefit from linear predictors to avoid overfitting in patient outcomes predictions. To this end, we introduce a new well-characterized clinicopathological dataset, including a retrospective collective of 374 patients, with their survival time and treatment information. Histomorphological clusters obtained by our method are evaluated by training survival models. The experimental results demonstrate statistically significant patient stratification, and our approach outperformed the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods.</p></details> |  |

We compare alternative architectures in terms of prediction accuracy and interpretability and show that our best model achieves a multiclass accuracy of 90.3% on topography site assignment and 84.8% on morphology type assignment. We found that in this context hierarchical models are not better than flat models and that an element-wise maximum aggregator is slightly better than attentive models on site classification. Moreover, the maximum aggregator offers a way to interpret the classification process.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (J-BHI)</p></details> |

However, manual classification for a huge number of reports on multiple tasks is labor-intensive. In this paper, we have developed an automatic text classifier based on BERT and we propose a human-centric metric to evaluate the model. According to the model confidence, we identify low-confidence cases that require further expert annotation and high-confidence cases that are automatically classified. We report the percentage of low-confidence cases and the performance of automatically classified cases. On the high-confidence cases, the model achieves classification accuracy comparable to pathologists. This leads a potential of reducing 80% to 98% of the manual annotation workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) at NeurIPS 2019 - Extended Abstract</p></details> |

Traditional methods such as taskspecific end-to-end models and pipeline models usually suffer from the lack of dataset and error propagation. In this paper, we present a question answering based clinical text structuring (QA-CTS) task to unify different specific tasks and make dataset shareable. A novel model that aims to introduce domain-specific features (e.g., clinical named entity information) into pre-trained language model is also proposed for QA-CTS task. Experimental results on Chinese pathology reports collected from Ruijing Hospital demonstrate our presented QA-CTS task is very effective to improve the performance on specific tasks. Our proposed model also competes favorably with strong baseline models in specific tasks.</p></details> |  |

For case usage, these models were applied for the annotation tasks in clinician-oriented pathology reports for prostatectomy specimens. The true positive rate (TPR) for slides with prostate cancer was 99.7% by a false positive rate of 0.785%. The F1-scores of Gleason patterns reported in pathology reports ranged from 0.795 to 1.0 at the case level. TPR was 93.6% for the cribriform morphology and 72.6% for the ductal morphology. The correlation between the ground truth and the prediction for the relative tumor volume was 0.987 n. Our models cover the major components of prostate pathology and successfully accomplish the annotation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Multitask Representation Learning for Pathology Biobank Metadata Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07846v1)** | 2019-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metadata are general characteristics of the data in a well-curated and condensed format, and have been proven to be useful for decision making, knowledge discovery, and also heterogeneous data organization of biobank. Among all data types in the biobank, pathology is the key component of the biobank and also serves as the gold standard of diagnosis. To maximize the utility of biobank and allow the rapid progress of biomedical science, it is essential to organize the data with well-populated pathology metadata. However, manual annotation of such information is tedious and time-consuming. In the study, we develop a multimodal multitask learning framework to predict four major slide-level metadata of pathology images. The framework learns generalizable representations across tissue slides, pathology reports, and case-level structured data. We demonstrate improved performance across all four tasks with the proposed method compared to a single modal single task baseline on two test sets, one external test set from a distinct data source (TCGA) and one internal held-out test set (TTH). In the test sets, the performance improvements on the averaged area under receiver operating characteristic curve across the four tasks are 16.48% and 9.05% on TCGA and TTH, respectively. Such pathology metadata prediction system may be adopted to mitigate the effort of expert annotation and ultimately accelerate the data-driven research by better utilization of the pathology biobank.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[Automatic Classification of Pathology Reports using TF-IDF Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07406v1)** | 2019-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Pathology report is arguably one of the most important documents in medicine containing interpretive information about the visual findings from the patient's biopsy sample. Each pathology report has a retention period of up to 20 years after the treatment of a patient. Cancer registries process and encode high volumes of free-text pathology reports for surveillance of cancer and tumor diseases all across the world. In spite of their extremely valuable information they hold, pathology reports are not used in any systematic way to facilitate computational pathology. Therefore, in this study, we investigate automated machine-learning techniques to identify/predict the primary diagnosis (based on ICD-O code) from pathology reports. We performed experiments by extracting the TF-IDF features from the reports and classifying them using three different methods---SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. We constructed a new dataset with 1,949 pathology reports arranged into 37 ICD-O categories, collected from four different primary sites, namely lung, kidney, thymus, and testis. The reports were manually transcribed into text format after collecting them as PDF files from NCI Genomic Data Commons public dataset. We subsequently pre-processed the reports by removing irrelevant textual artifacts produced by OCR software. The highest classification accuracy we achieved was 92\% using XGBoost classifier on TF-IDF feature vectors, the linear SVM scored 87\% accuracy. Furthermore, the study shows that TF-IDF vectors are suitable for highlighting the important keywords within a report which can be helpful for the cancer research and diagnostic workflow. The results are encouraging in demonstrating the potential of machine learning methods for classification and encoding of pathology reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevant Word Order Vectorization for Improved Natural Language Processing in Electronic Healthcare Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02627v1)** | 2018-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) represent a rich resource for conducting observational studies, supporting clinical trials, and more. However, much of the relevant information is stored in an unstructured format that makes it difficult to use. Natural language processing approaches that attempt to automatically classify the data depend on vectorization algorithms that impose structure on the text, but these algorithms were not designed for the unique characteristics of EHR. Here, we propose a new algorithm for structuring so-called free-text that may help researchers make better use of EHR. We call this method Relevant Word Order Vectorization (RWOV). Materials and Methods: As a proof-of-concept, we attempted to classify the hormone receptor status of breast cancer patients treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center during a recent year, from the unstructured text of pathology reports. Our approach attempts to account for the semi-structured way that healthcare providers often enter information. We compared this approach to the ngrams and word2vec methods. Results: Our approach resulted in the most consistently high accuracy, as measured by F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Discussion: Our results suggest that methods of structuring free text that take into account its context may show better performance, and that our approach is promising. Conclusion: By using a method that accounts for the fact that healthcare providers tend to use certain key words repetitively and that the order of these key words is important, we showed improved performance over methods that do not.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving pathology reports using business intelligence techniques: An experimental study](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03550v1)** | 2016-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health professionals use pathology reports to monitor and manage a patient's health. Typically, pathologists diagnose patients' conditions and produce these reports which are then used as reference by clinicians and eventually shared with the patient. Pathology reports are difficult to interpret as the reports are written using complex medical terminology. As patients only see their doctors for a limited time, the complexity of report content and the manner in which the information is presented in the reports may hinder patients' understanding of their medical condition and prognosis. The objective of this study was to compare patient comprehension of results from two pathology-reporting styles: the traditional format in current widespread use and new style developed using techniques common in business intelligence system (BI) development. The study found that the reports prepared using a "BI style" improve experimental subject's understanding and satisfaction with the reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>ISBN#...</summary><p>ISBN# 978-0-646-95337-3 Presented at the Australasian Conference on Information Systems 2015 (arXiv:1605.01032)</p></details> |

| **[Pathology Report Generation and Multimodal Representation Learning for Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19293v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of melanocytic skin lesions are examined by pathologists each year, the majority of which concern common nevi (i.e., ordinary moles). While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study. While report generation revealed to be more difficult for rare melanocytic lesion subtypes, the cross-modal retrieval performance for these cases was considerably better.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.19285</p></details> |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[PolyPath: Adapting a Large Multimodal Model for Multi-slide Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10536v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of histopathology cases underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions in medicine. Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Whole Slide Foundation Model for Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19666v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |
