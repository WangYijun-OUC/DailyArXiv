| **[Training-Free Synthetic Data Generation with Dual IP-Adapter Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22635v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025.

| **[Diffusion Curriculum: Synthetic-to-Real Data Curriculum via Image-Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13674v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV2025. 22 pages, including references and appendix.

| **[Rethinking the Embodied Gap in Vision-and-Language Navigation: A Holistic Study of Physical and Visual Disparities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13019v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available at https://crystalsixone.github.io/vln_pe.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification: Fine-Tuning Wav2Vec 2.0 with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11606v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 37 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **[Can Diffusion Models Disentangle? A Theoretical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00220v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding how diffusion models can learn disentangled representations. Within this framework, we establish identifiability conditions for general disentangled latent variable models, analyze training dynamics, and derive sample complexity bounds for disentangled latent subspace models. To validate our theory, we conduct disentanglement experiments across diverse tasks and modalities, including subspace recovery in latent subspace Gaussian mixture models, image colorization, image denoising, and voice conversion for speech classification. Additionally, our experiments show that training strategies inspired by our theory, such as style guidance regularization, consistently enhance disentanglement performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2I-Diff: fMRI Signal Generation via Time-Frequency Image Transform and Classifier-Free Denoising Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20822v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learning hidden cascades via classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11228v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully observable. However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to further spread the infection. While final statuses are hidden, intermediate indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide useful representations of the underlying diffusion process. We propose a partial observability-aware Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model. We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. Through extensive benchmarking against Approximate Bayesian Computation and GNN-based baselines, our framework consistently outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering accurate parameter estimates across diverse diffusion settings while scaling efficiently to large networks. We validate the method on synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world insider trading network, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual statuses is not possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Classifier-Driven Reward for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01143v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) mitigates the need for reward definition, aligning with human preferences via preference-driven reward feedback without interacting with the environment. However, trajectory-wise preference labels are difficult to meet the precise learning of step-wise reward, thereby affecting the performance of downstream algorithms. To alleviate the insufficient step-wise reward caused by trajectory-wise preferences, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). DPR directly treats step-wise preference-based reward acquisition as a binary classification and utilizes the robustness of diffusion classifiers to infer step-wise rewards discriminatively. In addition, to further utilize trajectory-wise preference information, we propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which conditions on trajectory-wise preference labels to enhance reward inference. We apply the above methods to existing offline RL algorithms, and a series of experimental results demonstrate that the diffusion classifier-driven reward outperforms the previous reward acquisition method with the Bradley-Terry model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19078v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Application Aligned Synthetic Surgical Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18796v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and $2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction builds on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes -- namely, the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET -- which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar--Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). Both the $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs adopt a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN), cascading the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation -- akin to local pooling in CNNs -- that can be performed either locally or per scale. Such pooling operations are more difficult to define in traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets and in geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, our approach extracts a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be combined with simple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification with far fewer trainable parameters than most modern graph neural networks require. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MHSNs on three distinct problem types: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |
| **[Elucidating the Design Space of FP4 training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17791v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of foundation models have spurred research into low-precision training, with 4-bit floating-point (\texttt{FP4}) formats emerging as a frontier for maximizing hardware throughput. While numerous techniques have been proposed to stabilize \texttt{FP4} training, they often present isolated solutions with varying, and not always clear, computational overheads. This paper aims to provide a unified view of the design space of \texttt{FP4} training. We introduce a comprehensive, quantisation gradient-based framework for microscaling quantization that allows for a theoretical analysis of the computational costs associated with different stabilization methods on both the forward and backward passes. Using a simulator built on this framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, image classification, diffusion models, and language models. By systematically evaluating thousands of combinations of techniques, such as novel gradient approximations, rounding strategies, and scaling methods, we identify which configurations offer the most favourable performance-to-overhead trade-off. We find that the techniques enabling the best trade-off involve carefully combining Hadamard transformations, tensor scaling and stochastic rounding. We further find that using \texttt{UE5M3} as a scaling factor potentially offers a good compromise between range and precision with manageable computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Edge-Specific Node Features through Co-Representation Neural Hypergraph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14286v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs are widely being employed to represent complex higher-order relations in real-world applications. Most existing research on hypergraph learning focuses on node-level or edge-level tasks. A practically relevant and more challenging task, edge-dependent node classification (ENC), is still under-explored. In ENC, a node can have different labels across different hyperedges, which requires the modeling of node features unique to each hyperedge. The state-of-the-art ENC solution, WHATsNet, only outputs single node and edge representations, leading to the limitations of \textbf{entangled edge-specific features} and \textbf{non-adaptive representation sizes} when applied to ENC. Additionally, WHATsNet suffers from the common \textbf{oversmoothing issue} in most HGNNs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoNHD}, a novel HGNN architecture specifically designed to model edge-specific features for ENC. Instead of learning separate representations for nodes and edges, CoNHD reformulates within-edge and within-node interactions as a hypergraph diffusion process over node-edge co-representations. We develop a neural implementation of the proposed diffusion process, leveraging equivariant networks as diffusion operators to effectively learn the diffusion dynamics from data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoNHD achieves the best performance across all benchmark ENC datasets and several downstream tasks without sacrificing efficiency. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/zhengyijia/CoNHD.</p></details> |  |

The framework integrates multi-task learning (MTL), GPT-based sentiment analysis, and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) propagation modeling. The study examines limitations in existing approaches. It models static production attributes, information dissemination, and audience sentiment at the same time. The framework uses 5,840 films from 2004 to 2024 and approximate 300,000 user reviews. It shows predictive performance with classification accuracy of 0.964 and regression metrics of MAE 0.388. Ablation analysis indicates component interactions. Selective feature combinations perform better than the comprehensive model. This result questions assumptions about feature integration. The model shows virality patterns between successful and unsuccessful films. Innovations include epidemiological modeling for information diffusion, multidimensional sentiment features from GPT-based analysis, and a shared representation architecture that optimizes multiple success metrics. The framework provides applications in the film production lifecycle. It also contributes to understanding how audience engagement leads to commercial outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved mmFormer for Liver Fibrosis Staging via Missing-Modality Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16436v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world clinical settings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently suffers from missing modalities due to equipment variability or patient cooperation issues, which can significantly affect model performance. To address this issue, we propose a multimodal MRI classification model based on the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module for handling arbitrary combinations of missing modalities. Specifically, this model retains the hybrid modality-specific encoders and the modality-correlated encoder from mmFormer to extract consistent lesion features across available modalities. In addition, we integrate a missing-modality compensation module which leverages zero-padding, modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical parameters to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing information. To further improve prediction performance, we adopt a cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different folds and applying soft voting during inference. This method is evaluated on the test set of Comprehensive Analysis & Computing of REal-world medical images (CARE) 2025 challenge, targeting the Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) task based on non-contrast dynamic MRI scans including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For Cirrhosis Detection and Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, our model obtains accuracies of 66.67%, and 74.17%, and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Cross-Modal Feature Extraction for Multi-Label Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15553v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce \textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that \textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts. The code is available at https://github.com/lt-0123/Diff-Feat.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Matrix Theory-guided sparse PCA for single-cell RNA-seq data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15429v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.</p></details> | 16 figures |

We investigate claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack. This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were found and discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages article, 29 pdf pages, 19 figures, MLRC.

| **[UMind: A Unified Multitask Network for Zero-Shot M/EEG Visual Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14772v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding visual information from time-resolved brain recordings, such as EEG and MEG, plays a pivotal role in real-time brain-computer interfaces. However, existing approaches primarily focus on direct brain-image feature alignment and are limited to single-task frameworks or task-specific models. In this paper, we propose a Unified MultItask Network for zero-shot M/EEG visual Decoding (referred to UMind), including visual stimulus retrieval, classification, and reconstruction, where multiple tasks mutually enhance each other. Our method learns robust neural-visual and semantic representations through multimodal alignment with both image and text modalities. The integration of both coarse and fine-grained texts enhances the extraction of these neural representations, enabling more detailed semantic and visual decoding. These representations then serve as dual conditional inputs to a pre-trained diffusion model, guiding visual reconstruction from both visual and semantic perspectives. Extensive evaluations on MEG and EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and biological plausibility of our approach in capturing spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Our approach sets a multitask pipeline for brain visual decoding, highlighting the synergy of semantic information in visual feature extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Reinforcement Learning-Guided Diffusion Model for Image Synthesis via Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Model Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14163v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models typically employ static or heuristic classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules, which often fail to adapt across timesteps and noise conditions. In this work, we introduce a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) controller that dynamically adjusts CFG at each denoising step. The controller adopts a hybrid quantum--classical actor--critic architecture: a shallow variational quantum circuit (VQC) with ring entanglement generates policy features, which are mapped by a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP) into Gaussian actions over $\Delta$CFG, while a classical critic estimates value functions. The policy is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), guided by a reward that balances classification confidence, perceptual improvement, and action regularization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our QRL policy improves perceptual quality (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) while reducing parameter count compared to classical RL actors and fixed schedules. Ablation studies on qubit number and circuit depth reveal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and extended evaluations confirm robust generation under long diffusion schedules.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecDiff: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Self-Speculation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13848v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff} achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information, \textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolvable Graph Diffusion Optimal Transport with Pattern-Specific Alignment for Brain Connectome Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16238v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network analysis of human brain connectivity indicates that individual differences in cognitive abilities arise from neurobiological mechanisms inherent in structural and functional brain networks. Existing studies routinely treat structural connectivity (SC) as optimal or fixed topological scaffolds for functional connectivity (FC), often overlooking higher-order dependencies between brain regions and limiting the modeling of complex cognitive processes. Besides, the distinct spatial organizations of SC and FC complicate direct integration, as naive alignment may distort intrinsic nonlinear patterns of brain connectivity. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Evolvable Graph Diffusion Optimal Transport with Pattern-Specific Alignment (EDT-PA), designed to identify disease-specific connectome patterns and classify brain disorders. To accurately model high-order structural dependencies, EDT-PA incorporates a spectrum of evolvable modeling blocks to dynamically capture high-order dependencies across brain regions. Additionally, a Pattern-Specific Alignment mechanism employs optimal transport to align structural and functional representations in a geometry-aware manner. By incorporating a Kolmogorov-Arnold network for flexible node aggregation, EDT-PA is capable of modeling complex nonlinear interactions among brain regions for downstream classification. Extensive evaluations on the REST-meta-MDD and ADNI datasets demonstrate that EDT-PA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a more effective framework for revealing structure-function misalignments and disorder-specific subnetworks in brain disorders.

| **[DRAG: Data Reconstruction Attack using Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11724v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms for large models in SI scenarios.

We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and food safety monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeeDiff: Off-the-Shelf Seeded Mask Generation from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19808v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Robustifying Diffusion-Denoised Smoothing Against Covariate Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10913v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results. However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ahedayat/Robustifying-DDS-Against-Covariate-Shift</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at: https://github.com/yurujaja/SatDiFuser.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, camera ready</p></details> |

Existing tabular generation approaches, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), typically require sufficient reference data, limiting their effectiveness in domain-specific databases with scarce records. While prompt-based LLMs offer flexibility without parameter tuning, they often fail to capture dataset-specific feature-label dependencies and generate redundant data, leading to degradation in downstream task performance. To overcome these issues, we propose ReFine, a framework that (i) derives symbolic "if-then" rules from interpretable models and embeds them into prompts to explicitly guide generation toward domain-specific feature distribution, and (ii) applies a dual-granularity filtering strategy that suppresses over-sampling patterns and selectively refines rare but informative samples to reduce distributional imbalance. Extensive experiments on various regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that ReFine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 0.44 absolute improvement in R-squared for regression and 10.0 percent relative improvement in F1 score for classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis.

| **[LLaDA-VLA: Vision Language Diffusion Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06932v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMS-Net:Dual-Modal Multi-Scale Siamese Network for Binocular Fundus Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18046v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ophthalmic diseases pose a significant global health burden. However, traditional diagnostic methods and existing monocular image-based deep learning approaches often overlook the pathological correlations between the two eyes. In practical medical robotic diagnostic scenarios, paired retinal images (binocular fundus images) are frequently required as diagnostic evidence. To address this, we propose DMS-Net-a dual-modal multi-scale siamese network for binocular retinal image classification. The framework employs a weight-sharing siamese ResNet-152 architecture to concurrently extract deep semantic features from bilateral fundus images. To tackle challenges like indistinct lesion boundaries and diffuse pathological distributions, we introduce the OmniPool Spatial Integrator Module (OSIM), which achieves multi-resolution feature aggregation through multi-scale adaptive pooling and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the Calibrated Analogous Semantic Fusion Module (CASFM) leverages spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention mechanisms to enhance cross-modal interaction, aggregating modality-agnostic representations of fundus structures. To fully exploit the differential semantic information of lesions present in bilateral fundus features, we introduce the Cross-Modal Contrastive Alignment Module (CCAM). Additionally, to enhance the aggregation of lesion-correlated semantic information, we introduce the Cross-Modal Integrative Alignment Module (CIAM). Evaluation on the ODIR-5K dataset demonstrates that DMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 82.9%, recall of 84.5%, and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 83.2%, showcasing robust capacity in detecting symmetrical pathologies and improving clinical decision-making for ocular diseases. Code and the processed dataset will be released subsequently.</p></details> |  |

However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.</p></details> |  |

We propose a framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI 2025)</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments.

| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  |

Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning for LiDAR-Based Indoor Surface Classification in Intelligent Wireless Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03813v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories, using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior. A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity, including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio, were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.</p></details> |  |

While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g., camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data. We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception.</p></details> |  |

Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as the model size increases. In this work, we proposed an EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained it using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) framework. Subsequently, the resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used multi-event datasets covering both interictal epileptiform discharges (TUEV) and seizure (CHB-MIT) detection, and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed the existing methods. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our source code and checkpoint are available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EEGDM...</summary><p>EEGDM Preprint 10 Pages</p></details> |

These two aspects hinder the development of accurate machine learning models. While generative AI offers a promising solution, producing synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers remains challenging. This work addresses the classification of individual white blood cells, a critical task in diagnosing hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We introduce CytoDiff, a stable diffusion model fine-tuned with LoRA weights and guided by few-shot samples that generates high-fidelity synthetic white blood cell images. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in classifier performance when training data is limited. Using a small, highly imbalanced real dataset, the addition of 5,000 synthetic images per class improved ResNet classifier accuracy from 27\% to 78\% (+51\%). Similarly, CLIP-based classification accuracy increased from 62\% to 77\% (+15\%).

Representative data augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods.

However, directly generating bird call waveforms from noisy field recordings remains a major challenge. We propose BirdDiff, a generative framework designed to synthesize bird calls from a noisy dataset of 12 wild bird species. The model incorporates a "zeroth layer" stage for multi-scale adaptive bird-call enhancement, followed by a diffusion-based generator conditioned on three modalities: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, species labels, and textual descriptions. The enhancement stage improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing spectral distortion, achieving the highest SNR gain (+10.45 dB) and lowest Itakura-Saito Distance (0.54) compared to three widely used non-training enhancement methods. We evaluate BirdDiff against a baseline generative model, DiffWave. Our method yields substantial improvements in generative quality metrics: Fr\'echet Audio Distance (0.590 to 0.213), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (0.259 to 0.226), and Number of Statistically-Different Bins (7.33 to 5.58). To assess species-specific detail preservation, we use a ResNet50 classifier trained on the original dataset to identify generated samples. Classification accuracy improves from 35.9% (DiffWave) to 70.1% (BirdDiff), with 8 of 12 species exceeding 70% accuracy. These results demonstrate that BirdDiff enables high-fidelity, controllable bird call generation directly from noisy field recordings.</p></details> |  |

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</p></details> | 55 pages, 10 figures |

To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI CAPI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Local Focusing Mechanism for Deepfake Detection Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17029v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains (e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories, especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP) compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP) module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789 FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in https://github.com/lmlpy/LFM.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Performance, Robustness, and Fairness of Radiographic AI Models with Finely-Controllable Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16783v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning, facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions, we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a 6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models, compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code, trained models, and synthetic dataset at https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/RoentGen-v2 .</p></details> |  |
| **[CCD: Continual Consistency Diffusion for Lifelong Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11936v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based models have shown remarkable generative capabilities in static settings, their extension to continual learning (CL) scenarios remains fundamentally constrained by Generative Catastrophic Forgetting (GCF). We observe that even with a rehearsal buffer, new generative skills often overwrite previous ones, degrading performance on earlier tasks. Although some initial efforts have explored this space, most rely on heuristics borrowed from continual classification methods or use trained diffusion models as ad hoc replay generators, lacking a principled, unified solution to mitigating GCF and often conducting experiments under fragmented and inconsistent settings. To address this gap, we introduce the Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG), a structured pipeline that redefines how diffusion models are implemented under CL and enables systematic evaluation of GCF. Beyond the empirical pipeline, we propose the first theoretical foundation for CDG, grounded in a cross-task analysis of diffusion-specific generative dynamics. Our theoretical investigation identifies three fundamental consistency principles essential for preserving knowledge in the rehearsal buffer over time: inter-task knowledge consistency, unconditional knowledge consistency, and prior knowledge consistency. These criteria expose the latent mechanisms through which generative forgetting manifests across sequential tasks. Motivated by these insights, we further propose \textit{Continual Consistency Diffusion} (CCD), a principled training framework that enforces these consistency objectives via hierarchical loss functions: $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{PKC}$. Extensive experiments show that CCD achieves SOTA performance across various benchmarks, especially improving generative metrics in overlapping-task scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Voxel Diffusion Module for Point Cloud 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16069v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing, which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions, submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1) diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization, highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7 mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | submit to AAAI2026 |
| **[NucleiMix: Realistic Data Augmentation for Nuclei Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16671v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclei instance segmentation is an essential task in pathology image analysis, serving as the foundation for many downstream applications. The release of several public datasets has significantly advanced research in this area, yet many existing methods struggle with data imbalance issues. To address this challenge, this study introduces a data augmentation method, called NucleiMix, which is designed to balance the distribution of nuclei types by increasing the number of rare-type nuclei within datasets. NucleiMix operates in two phases. In the first phase, it identifies candidate locations similar to the surroundings of rare-type nuclei and inserts rare-type nuclei into the candidate locations. In the second phase, it employs a progressive inpainting strategy using a pre-trained diffusion model to seamlessly integrate rare-type nuclei into their new environments in replacement of major-type nuclei or background locations. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of NucleiMix on three public datasets using two popular nuclei instance segmentation models. The results demonstrate the superior ability of NucleiMix to synthesize realistic rare-type nuclei and to enhance the quality of nuclei segmentation and classification in an accurate and robust manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic watermarks in images generated by diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08927v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but their widespread use raises significant ethical concerns, including intellectual property protection and the misuse of synthetic media. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sealing The Backdoor: Unlearning Adversarial Text Triggers In Diffusion Models Using Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18235v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach, Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative models.

The quality of tongue surface segmentation significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by 96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool (available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available tongue image segmentation tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tongu...</summary><p>Tongue segmentation, data augmentation, synthetic data for AI training, prompt engineering, Segment Anything Model, knowledge distillation, tongue classification</p></details> |

As high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real images.

| **[AI-Augmented Thyroid Scintigraphy for Robust Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00366v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Thyroid scintigraphy plays a vital role in diagnosing a range of thyroid disorders. While deep learning classification models hold significant promise in this domain, their effectiveness is frequently compromised by limited and imbalanced datasets. This study investigates the impact of three data augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a ResNet18 classifier. Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine medical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID). Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context. O+FM+CA yielded the most balanced and robust performance across all classes. Conclusion: Integrating FM and clinically-informed SD augmentation, especially when guided by expert prompts, substantially improves thyroid scintigraphy classification. These findings highlight the importance of leveraging both structured medical input and advanced generative models for more effective training on limited datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Full Back-propagation or Full Forward-propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24322v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a gradient term at each block by back-propagating the error signal from the output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each block builds on the representation of the block below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top blocks of the model, while features on lower blocks are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation across the entire network. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each block independently learns to denoise a noisy target using only local targets and back-propagation within the block. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of learning methods that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each block beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm, is easy to use and computationally efficient. By departing from the traditional learning paradigm which requires back-propagating a global error signal, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for CoLLAs 2025</p></details> |
| **[Noise Matters: Optimizing Matching Noise for Diffusion Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11330v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising effects with different category conditions to classify categories. Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles, we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good) noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of NoOp.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Diffusion via Generalized Opinion Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11249v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3) theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> |  |

They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model for the rest.</p></details> |  |

Such points are of intrinsic interest in the local theory of measures on metric spaces and also arise naturally in the study of Bayesian inverse problems and diffusion processes. Building upon special cases already proposed in the literature, this paper develops a systematic framework for defining modes through small-ball probabilities. We propose `common-sense' axioms that such definitions should obey, including appropriate treatment of discrete and absolutely continuous measures, as well as symmetry and invariance properties. We show that there are exactly ten such definitions consistent with these axioms, and that they are partially but not totally ordered in strength, forming a complete, distributive lattice. We also show how this classification simplifies for well-behaved $\mu$.</p></details> | 63 pages |

As model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17), becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from design configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based optimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less complex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable, non-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search. We further extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and 1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17) design spaces. For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DOSA framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 24 figures, 8 tables, 54 references</p></details> |
| **[Non-asymptotic convergence bound of conditional diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10944v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning and generating various types of data based on conditional diffusion models has been a research hotspot in recent years. Although conditional diffusion models have made considerable progress in improving acceleration algorithms and enhancing generation quality, the lack of non-asymptotic properties has hindered theoretical research. To address this gap, we focus on a conditional diffusion model within the domains of classification and regression (CARD), which aims to learn the original distribution with given input x (denoted as Y|X). It innovatively integrates a pre-trained model f_{\phi}(x) into the original diffusion model framework, allowing it to precisely capture the original conditional distribution given f (expressed as Y|f_{\phi}(x)). Remarkably, when f_{\phi}(x) performs satisfactorily, Y|f_{\phi}(x) closely approximates Y|X. Theoretically, we deduce the stochastic differential equations of CARD and establish its generalized form predicated on the Fokker-Planck equation, thereby erecting a firm theoretical foundation for analysis. Mainly under the Lipschitz assumptions, we utilize the second-order Wasserstein distance to demonstrate the upper error bound between the original and the generated conditional distributions. Additionally, by appending assumptions such as light-tailedness to the original distribution, we derive the convergence upper bound between the true value analogous to the score function and the corresponding network-estimated value.</p></details> |  |

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PMLR 298, 10th Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (MLHC)</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Situ Fine-Tuning of Wildlife Models in IoT-Enabled Camera Traps for Efficient Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07796v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models, however, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Our background-aware synthesis surpasses efficient baselines by 7.3\% and diffusion models by 3.0\% while being orders of magnitude faster, our drift-aware fine-tuning achieves Pareto optimality with 50\% fewer updates and 1.5\% higher accuracy, and the end-to-end system outperforms domain adaptation approaches by 20--35%\% while consuming only 11.2 Wh over 37 days -- enabling battery-powered deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task Adversarial Attacks against Black-box Model with Few-shot Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10039v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble \textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a \textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and allowing attacks across various tasks. CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks substitute models. In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100 queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (LMID Workshop)</p></details> |

We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGGRAPH 2025 (Conference Track).

| **[Towards Robust Red-Green Watermarking for Autoregressive Image Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06656v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive (AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images. Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality. Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime, comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Sub-Visible Particle Classification in Flow Imaging Microscopy via Generative AI-Based Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06021v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles. However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure. To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising 500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at https://github.com/utkuozbulak/svp-generative-ai.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11772v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing, tackling the challenge of limited generalization in task-oriented synthesis for RSI interpretation. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy with a three-dimensional batch-sample selection mechanism to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios. There are significant improvements in open-vocabulary understanding tasks, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.</p></details> | 25 pages |

This is particularly advantageous in diffused lung disease research, where annotated imaging datasets are scarce. To leverage this, we train an MAE on a curated collection of over 5,000 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, combining in-house data with publicly available scans from related conditions that exhibit similar radiological patterns, such as COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The pretrained MAE is then fine-tuned on a downstream classification task for diffused lung disease diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that MAEs can effectively extract clinically meaningful features and improve diagnostic performance, even in the absence of large-scale labelled datasets. The code and the models are available here: https://github.com/eedack01/lung_masked_autoencoder.</p></details> |  |

One vital component often found in such document processing workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use, remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain the decisions of document image classification models through feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3 different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.</p></details> |  |

While some recent works have explored Differential Privacy (DP) to mitigate these privacy risks, DP-based training is known to cause significant performance degradation and impose several limitations on standard training procedures, making its direct application to downstream tasks both difficult and costly. In this work, we aim to address the above challenges within the context of document image classification by substituting real private data with a synthetic counterpart. In particular, we propose to use conditional latent diffusion models (LDMs) in combination with differential privacy (DP) to generate class-specific synthetic document images under strict privacy constraints, which can then be utilized to train a downstream classifier following standard training procedures. We investigate our approach under various pretraining setups, including unconditional, class-conditional, and layout-conditional pretraining, in combination with multiple private training strategies such as class-conditional and per-label private fine-tuning with DPDM and DP-Promise algorithms. Additionally, we evaluate it on two well-known document benchmark datasets, RVL-CDIP and Tobacco3482, and show that it can generate useful and realistic document samples across various document types and privacy levels ($\varepsilon \in \{1, 5, 10\}$). Lastly, we show that our approach achieves substantial performance improvements in downstream evaluations on small-scale datasets, compared to the direct application of DP-Adam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDAR 2025</p></details> |

Utility Control for AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead, NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation, using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of tasks without requiring a lot of changes.</p></details> |  |

We identify three critical limitations in current emotional talking head generation: insufficient utilization of audio's inherent emotional cues, identity leakage in emotion representations, and isolated learning of emotion correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework dubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion, and then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics. First, we develop a disentangled emotion embedder that jointly models audio-visual emotional cues through cross-modal attention, representing emotions as identity-agnostic Gaussian distributions. Second, we introduce a correlation-enhanced emotion conditioning module with learnable Emotion Banks that explicitly capture inter-emotion relationships through vector quantization and attention-based feature aggregation. Third, we design an emotion discrimination objective that enforces affective consistency during the diffusion process through latent-space classification. Extensive experiments on MEAD and HDTF datasets demonstrate our method's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in emotion accuracy while maintaining competitive lip-sync performance. Qualitative results and user studies further confirm our method's ability to generate identity-preserving portraits with rich, correlated emotional expressions that naturally adapt to unseen identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'25. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.03270</p></details> |
| **[From Pixels to Pathology: Restoration Diffusion for Diagnostic-Consistent Virtual IHC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02528v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing OOD Detection Using Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16525v4)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios, enabling the identification of unknown samples or objects. A prominent approach to enhance OOD detection performance involves leveraging auxiliary datasets for training. Recent efforts have explored using generative models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to synthesize outlier data in the pixel space. However, synthesizing OOD data in the pixel space can lead to reduced robustness due to over-generation. To address this challenge, we propose Outlier-Aware Learning (OAL), a novel framework that generates synthetic OOD training data within the latent space, taking a further step to study how to utilize Stable Diffusion for developing a latent-based outlier synthesis approach. This improvement facilitates network training with fewer outliers and less computational cost. Besides, to regularize the model's decision boundary, we develop a mutual information-based contrastive learning module (MICL) that amplifies the distinction between In-Distribution (ID) and collected OOD data. Moreover, we develop a knowledge distillation module to prevent the degradation of ID classification accuracy when training with OOD data. The superior performance of our method on several benchmark datasets demonstrates its efficiency and effectiveness. Source code is available in https://github.com/HengGao12/OAL.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01292v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.</p></details> |  |

One research focus is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs. However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of explainable models in medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at iMIMIC - Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image Computing workshop MICCAI 2025 Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention</p></details> |

Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025.

To address this issue, we propose a multimodal MRI classification model based on the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module for handling arbitrary combinations of missing modalities. Specifically, this model retains the hybrid modality-specific encoders and the modality-correlated encoder from mmFormer to extract consistent lesion features across available modalities. In addition, we integrate a missing-modality compensation module which leverages zero-padding, modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical parameters to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing information. To further improve prediction performance, we adopt a cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different folds and applying soft voting during inference. This method is evaluated on the test set of Comprehensive Analysis & Computing of REal-world medical images (CARE) 2025 challenge, targeting the Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) task based on non-contrast dynamic MRI scans including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For Cirrhosis Detection and Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, our model obtains accuracies of 66.67%, and 74.17%, and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMS-Net:Dual-Modal Multi-Scale Siamese Network for Binocular Fundus Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18046v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ophthalmic diseases pose a significant global health burden. However, traditional diagnostic methods and existing monocular image-based deep learning approaches often overlook the pathological correlations between the two eyes. In practical medical robotic diagnostic scenarios, paired retinal images (binocular fundus images) are frequently required as diagnostic evidence. To address this, we propose DMS-Net-a dual-modal multi-scale siamese network for binocular retinal image classification. The framework employs a weight-sharing siamese ResNet-152 architecture to concurrently extract deep semantic features from bilateral fundus images. To tackle challenges like indistinct lesion boundaries and diffuse pathological distributions, we introduce the OmniPool Spatial Integrator Module (OSIM), which achieves multi-resolution feature aggregation through multi-scale adaptive pooling and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the Calibrated Analogous Semantic Fusion Module (CASFM) leverages spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention mechanisms to enhance cross-modal interaction, aggregating modality-agnostic representations of fundus structures. To fully exploit the differential semantic information of lesions present in bilateral fundus features, we introduce the Cross-Modal Contrastive Alignment Module (CCAM). Additionally, to enhance the aggregation of lesion-correlated semantic information, we introduce the Cross-Modal Integrative Alignment Module (CIAM).

We propose a framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI 2025)</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments.

Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

These two aspects hinder the development of accurate machine learning models. While generative AI offers a promising solution, producing synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers remains challenging. This work addresses the classification of individual white blood cells, a critical task in diagnosing hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We introduce CytoDiff, a stable diffusion model fine-tuned with LoRA weights and guided by few-shot samples that generates high-fidelity synthetic white blood cell images. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in classifier performance when training data is limited. Using a small, highly imbalanced real dataset, the addition of 5,000 synthetic images per class improved ResNet classifier accuracy from 27\% to 78\% (+51\%). Similarly, CLIP-based classification accuracy increased from 62\% to 77\% (+15\%).

Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning, facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions, we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a 6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models, compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code, trained models, and synthetic dataset at https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/RoentGen-v2 .</p></details> |  |

As high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real images.

| **[AI-Augmented Thyroid Scintigraphy for Robust Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00366v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Thyroid scintigraphy plays a vital role in diagnosing a range of thyroid disorders. While deep learning classification models hold significant promise in this domain, their effectiveness is frequently compromised by limited and imbalanced datasets. This study investigates the impact of three data augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a ResNet18 classifier. Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine medical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID). Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context. O+FM+CA yielded the most balanced and robust performance across all classes. Conclusion: Integrating FM and clinically-informed SD augmentation, especially when guided by expert prompts, substantially improves thyroid scintigraphy classification. These findings highlight the importance of leveraging both structured medical input and advanced generative models for more effective training on limited datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

One research focus is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs. However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of explainable models in medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at iMIMIC - Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image Computing workshop MICCAI 2025 Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention</p></details> |

Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025.

However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case subgroup performance.

However, the scarcity of data and the class imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data, contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.</p></details> |  |

However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging.

However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features for Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23460v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2025</p></details> |

Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</p></details> |

To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aiding Medical Diagnosis through Image Synthesis and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00786v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical professionals, especially those in training, often depend on visual reference materials to support an accurate diagnosis and develop pattern recognition skills. However, existing resources may lack the diversity and accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other areas of medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool for medical AI applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion bridge model for 3D brain image translation between T1w MRI and DTI modalities. Our model learns to generate high-quality DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) images from T1w images and vice versa, enabling cross-modality data augmentation and reducing the need for extensive DTI acquisition. We evaluate our approach using perceptual similarity, pixel-level agreement, and distributional consistency metrics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing anatomical structures and preserving information on white matter integrity. The practical utility of the synthetic data is validated through sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks, where the generated images achieve comparable performance to real data. Our diffusion bridge model offers a promising solution for improving neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical decision-making, with the potential to significantly impact neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, current research on optimization algorithms in federated learning often focuses on limited datasets and scenarios, primarily centered around natural images, with insufficient comparative experiments in medical contexts. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms in the context of medical imaging. We conduct a fair comparison of classification models trained using various federated learning algorithms across multiple medical imaging datasets. Additionally, we evaluate system performance metrics, such as communication cost and computational efficiency, while considering different federated learning architectures. Our findings show that medical imaging datasets pose substantial challenges for current federated learning optimization algorithms. No single algorithm consistently delivers optimal performance across all medical federated learning scenarios, and many optimization algorithms may underperform when applied to these datasets. Our experiments provide a benchmark and guidance for future research and application of federated learning in medical imaging contexts. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and robust method that combines generative techniques using denoising diffusion probabilistic models with label smoothing to augment datasets, widely enhancing the performance of federated learning on classification tasks across various medical imaging datasets. Our code will be released on GitHub, offering a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for future federated learning studies in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the datasets PAD-UFES-20 for skin cancer and P-NDB-UFES for oral cancer, the diffusion model demonstrated competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Specifically, for the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, the model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.6457 for six-class classification and 0.8357 for binary classification (cancer vs. non-cancer). For the P-NDB-UFES dataset, it attained a balanced accuracy of 0.9050. These results suggest that diffusion models are viable models for classifying medical images of skin and oral lesions. In addition, we investigate the robustness of the model trained on PAD-UFES-20 for skin cancer but tested on the clinical images of the HIBA dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiN: Diffusion Model for Robust Medical VQA with Semantic Noisy Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18536v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) systems benefit the interpretation of medical images containing critical clinical information. However, the challenge of noisy labels and limited high-quality datasets remains underexplored. To address this, we establish the first benchmark for noisy labels in Med-VQA by simulating human mislabeling with semantically designed noise types. More importantly, we introduce the DiN framework, which leverages a diffusion model to handle noisy labels in Med-VQA. Unlike the dominant classification-based VQA approaches that directly predict answers, our Answer Diffuser (AD) module employs a coarse-to-fine process, refining answer candidates with a diffusion model for improved accuracy. The Answer Condition Generator (ACG) further enhances this process by generating task-specific conditional information via integrating answer embeddings with fused image-question features. To address label noise, our Noisy Label Refinement(NLR) module introduces a robust loss function and dynamic answer adjustment to further boost the performance of the AD module.</p></details> |  |

However, their application is often hindered by data scarcity, both in terms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a novel application of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to the landmark detection task, specifically addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in x-ray imaging. Our key innovation lies in leveraging DDPMs for self-supervised pre-training in landmark detection, a previously unexplored approach in this domain. This method enables accurate landmark detection with minimal annotated training data (as few as 50 images), surpassing both ImageNet supervised pre-training and traditional self-supervised techniques across three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[FedBiP: Heterogeneous One-Shot Federated Learning with Personalized Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04810v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL), a special decentralized machine learning paradigm, has recently gained significant attention. OSFL requires only a single round of client data or model upload, which reduces communication costs and mitigates privacy threats compared to traditional FL. Despite these promising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data heterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL systems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on large-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these issues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results in significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance degradation in classification models trained on such data. This issue is particularly pronounced in rare domains, such as medical imaging, which are underrepresented in LDM's pretraining data. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the pretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP synthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without compromising the privacy regulations. FedBiP is also the first approach to simultaneously address feature space heterogeneity and client data scarcity in OSFL. Our method is validated through extensive experiments on three OSFL benchmarks with feature space heterogeneity, as well as on challenging medical and satellite image datasets with label heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiP, which substantially outperforms other OSFL methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Flow Matching for Medical Image Synthesis: Bridging the Gap Between Speed and Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00266v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for various medical applications. However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications. Code with checkpoints and a synthetic dataset (beneficial for classification and segmentation) is now available on: https://github.com/milad1378yz/MOTFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable, Multi-modal Wound Infection Classification from Images Augmented with Generated Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20277v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infections in Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) can cause severe complications, including tissue death and limb amputation, highlighting the need for accurate, timely diagnosis. Previous machine learning methods have focused on identifying infections by analyzing wound images alone, without utilizing additional metadata such as medical notes. In this study, we aim to improve infection detection by introducing Synthetic Caption Augmented Retrieval for Wound Infection Detection (SCARWID), a novel deep learning framework that leverages synthetic textual descriptions to augment DFU images. SCARWID consists of two components: (1) Wound-BLIP, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on GPT-4o-generated descriptions to synthesize consistent captions from images; and (2) an Image-Text Fusion module that uses cross-attention to extract cross-modal embeddings from an image and its corresponding Wound-BLIP caption. Infection status is determined by retrieving the top-k similar items from a labeled support set. To enhance the diversity of training data, we utilized a latent diffusion model to generate additional wound images. As a result, SCARWID outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively, for wound infection classification. Displaying the generated captions alongside the wound images and infection detection results enhances interpretability and trust, enabling nurses to align SCARWID outputs with their medical knowledge. This is particularly valuable when wound notes are unavailable or when assisting novice nurses who may find it difficult to identify visual attributes of wound infection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Polyp Detection and Diagnosis through Compositional Prompt-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17951v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern, and early detection through screening plays a critical role in reducing mortality. While deep learning models have shown promise in improving polyp detection, classification, and segmentation, their generalization across diverse clinical environments, particularly with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, remains a challenge. Multi-center datasets like PolypGen have been developed to address these issues, but their collection is costly and time-consuming. Traditional data augmentation techniques provide limited variability, failing to capture the complexity of medical images. Diffusion models have emerged as a promising solution for generating synthetic polyp images, but the image generation process in current models mainly relies on segmentation masks as the condition, limiting their ability to capture the full clinical context. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Progressive Spectrum Diffusion Model (PSDM) that integrates diverse clinical annotations-such as segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and colonoscopy reports-by transforming them into compositional prompts. These prompts are organized into coarse and fine components, allowing the model to capture both broad spatial structures and fine details, generating clinically accurate synthetic images. By augmenting training data with PSDM-generated samples, our model significantly improves polyp detection, classification, and segmentation. For instance, on the PolypGen dataset, PSDM increases the F1 score by 2.12% and the mean average precision by 3.09%, demonstrating superior performance in OOD scenarios and enhanced generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Medical Vision-Language Pre-training Succeed with Purely Synthetic Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13523v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP) has made significant progress in enabling zero-shot tasks for medical image understanding. However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: "Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?" To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained exclusively on synthetic data outperform those trained on real data by 3.8% in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of 9.07%. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.</p></details> | Under Review |

Morphological factors such as size, location, texture, and variable appearance complicate tumor inspection. Medical imaging presents challenges, including noise and incomplete images. This research article presents a methodology for processing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, encompassing techniques for image classification and denoising. The effective use of MRI images allows medical professionals to detect brain disorders, including tumors. This research aims to categorize healthy brain tissue and brain tumors by analyzing the provided MRI data. Unlike alternative methods like Computed Tomography (CT), MRI technology offers a more detailed representation of internal anatomical components, making it a suitable option for studying data related to brain tumors. The MRI picture is first subjected to a denoising technique utilizing an Anisotropic diffusion filter. The dataset utilized for the models creation is a publicly accessible and validated Brain Tumour Classification (MRI) database, comprising 3,264 brain MRI scans. SMOTE was employed for data augmentation and dataset balancing. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) such as ResNet152V2, VGG, ViT, and EfficientNet were employed for the classification procedure. EfficientNet attained an accuracy of 98%, the highest recorded.</p></details> |  |

However, the creation of high-quality annotated datasets for training remains a major challenge. This study introduces a novel single-stage approach (HistoSmith) for generating image-label pairs to augment histology datasets. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with separate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a latent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts, classification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data generation by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types, quantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset and the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and diverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell instance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented cell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.</p></details> |  |

Image generation has immense potential in medical imaging because open-source medical images are difficult to obtain compared to natural images, especially for rare conditions. The generated images can be used later to train classification and segmentation models. In this paper, we propose simulating realistic ultrasound (US) images by successive fine-tuning of large diffusion models on different publicly available databases. To do so, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, on BUSI (Breast US Images) an ultrasound breast image dataset. We successfully generated high-quality US images of the breast using simple prompts that specify the organ and pathology, which appeared realistic to three experienced US scientists and a US radiologist. Additionally, we provided user control by conditioning the model with segmentations through ControlNet.

Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

However, as the text to nature image models, we show that the T2MedI model can also bias to some subgroups to overlook the minority ones in the training set. In this work, we first build a T2MedI model based on the pre-trained Imagen model, which has the fixed contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) text encoder, while its decoder has been fine-tuned on medical images from the Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset. Its gender bias is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Toward this issue, we propose to fine-tune the T2MedI toward the target application dataset to align their sensitive subgroups distribution probability. Specifically, the alignment loss for fine-tuning is guided by an off-the-shelf sensitivity-subgroup classifier to match the classification probability between the generated images and the expected target dataset. In addition, the image quality is maintained by a CLIP-consistency regularization term following a knowledge distillation scheme. For evaluation, we set the target dataset to be enhanced as the BraST18 dataset, and trained a brain magnetic resonance (MR) slice-based gender classifier from it. With our method, the generated MR image can markedly reduce the inconsistency with the gender proportion in the BraTS18 dataset.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

Diffusion models, a recent generative modeling technique, offer a potential solution by generating synthetic and realistic data. However, questions remain about the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on original and synthetic datasets. If diffusion-generated samples can help CNN models perform comparably to those trained on original datasets, reliance on patient-specific data for training CNNs might be reduced. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of diffusion models for generating synthetic medical images to train CNNs in three domains: Brain Tumor MRI, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), and SARS-CoV-2 CT scans. A diffusion model was trained to generate synthetic datasets for each domain. Pre-trained CNN architectures were then trained on these synthetic datasets and evaluated on unseen real data. All three datasets achieved promising classification performance using CNNs trained on synthetic data. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) analysis revealed that the models focused on relevant image features for classification. This study demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to generate synthetic medical images for training CNNs in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this study explores the use of generative models, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Progressive Growing Generative Adversarial Networks (PGGANs), for dataset augmentation. The research introduces a framework to assess the impact of synthetic images generated by DDPM and PGGANs on the performance of four models: a custom CNN, Untrained VGG16, Pretrained VGG16, and Pretrained ResNet50. Experiments were conducted using Random Sampling and Greedy K Sampling to create small, imbalanced datasets. The synthetic images were evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and compared to original datasets through classification metrics. The results show that DDPM consistently generated more realistic images with lower FID scores and significantly outperformed PGGANs in improving classification metrics across all models and datasets. Incorporating DDPM-generated images into the original datasets increased accuracy by up to 6%, enhancing model robustness and stability, particularly in imbalanced scenarios. Random Sampling demonstrated superior stability, while Greedy K Sampling offered diversity at the cost of higher FID scores. This study highlights the efficacy of DDPM in augmenting small, imbalanced medical image datasets, improving model performance by balancing the dataset and expanding its size.</p></details> |  |

While radiologists build such expertise over years of experience, it is challenging for AI models to learn where to look with limited amounts of training data. This limitation results in unsatisfying robustness in medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion-based Feature Augmentation (DAug), a portable method that improves a perception model's performance with a generative model's output. Specifically, we extend a radiology image to multiple channels, with the additional channels being the heatmaps of regions where diseases tend to develop. A diffusion-based image-to-image translation model was used to generate such heatmaps conditioned on selected disease classes. Our method is motivated by the fact that generative models learn the distribution of normal and abnormal images, and such knowledge is complementary to image understanding tasks. In addition, we propose the Image-Text-Class Hybrid Contrastive learning to utilize both text and class labels. With two novel approaches combined, our method surpasses baseline models without changing the model architecture, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both medical image retrieval and classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating and Improving the Effectiveness of Synthetic Chest X-Rays for Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18602v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To explore best-practice approaches for generating synthetic chest X-ray images and augmenting medical imaging datasets to optimize the performance of deep learning models in downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CytoDiffusion, a diffusion-based classifier that effectively models blood cell morphology, combining accurate classification with robust anomaly detection, resistance to distributional shifts, interpretability, data efficiency, and superhuman uncertainty quantification. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative models in anomaly detection (AUC 0.990 vs. 0.918), resistance to domain shifts (85.85% vs. 74.38% balanced accuracy), and performance in low-data regimes (95.88% vs. 94.95% balanced accuracy). Notably, our model generates synthetic blood cell images that are nearly indistinguishable from real images, as demonstrated by an authenticity test in which expert haematologists achieved only 52.3% accuracy (95% CI: [50.5%, 54.2%]) in distinguishing real from generated images. Furthermore, we enhance model explainability through the generation of directly interpretable counterfactual heatmaps. Our comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing these multiple performance dimensions, establishes a new benchmark for medical image analysis in haematology, ultimately enabling improved diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.

This paper introduces Diffusion-Driven Diagnosis (D-Cube), a novel approach that leverages hyper-features from a diffusion model combined with contrastive learning to improve cancer diagnosis. D-Cube employs advanced feature selection techniques that utilize the robust representational capabilities of diffusion models, enhancing classification performance on medical datasets under challenging conditions such as data imbalance and limited sample availability. The feature selection process optimizes the extraction of clinically relevant features, significantly improving classification accuracy and demonstrating resilience in imbalanced and limited data scenarios. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of D-Cube across multiple medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and X-ray, showing superior performance compared to existing baseline models. D-Cube represents a new strategy in cancer detection, employing advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

This is especially problematic in medical settings, where biased models fail when applied to different hospitals or systems. In such cases, data-driven methods to reduce spurious correlations are preferred, as clinicians can directly validate the modified images. While Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Diffusion Models) show promise for natural images, they are impractical for medical use due to the difficulty of describing spurious medical features. To address this, we propose Masked Medical Image Inpainting (MaskMedPaint), which uses text-to-image diffusion models to augment training images by inpainting areas outside key classification regions to match the target domain. We demonstrate that MaskMedPaint enhances generalization to target domains across both natural (Waterbirds, iWildCam) and medical (ISIC 2018, Chest X-ray) datasets, given limited unlabeled target images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 12 pages</p></details> |

The medical imaging domain faces unique challenges due to scarce data labelling -- insufficient for standard training, and critical nature of the applications that require high performance, confidence, and explainability of the models. In this work, we propose to tackle those challenges with a single model that combines standard classification with a diffusion-based generative task in a single shared parametrisation. By sharing representations, our model effectively learns from both labeled and unlabeled data while at the same time providing accurate explanations through counterfactual examples. In our experiments, we show that our Mediffusion achieves results comparable to recent semi-supervised methods while providing more reliable and precise explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extrapolating Prospective Glaucoma Fundus Images through Diffusion Model in Irregular Longitudinal Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21130v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utilization of longitudinal datasets for glaucoma progression prediction offers a compelling approach to support early therapeutic interventions. Predominant methodologies in this domain have primarily focused on the direct prediction of glaucoma stage labels from longitudinal datasets. However, such methods may not adequately encapsulate the nuanced developmental trajectory of the disease. To enhance the diagnostic acumen of medical practitioners, we propose a novel diffusion-based model to predict prospective images by extrapolating from existing longitudinal fundus images of patients. The methodology delineated in this study distinctively leverages sequences of images as inputs. Subsequently, a time-aligned mask is employed to select a specific year for image generation. During the training phase, the time-aligned mask resolves the issue of irregular temporal intervals in longitudinal image sequence sampling. Additionally, we utilize a strategy of randomly masking a frame in the sequence to establish the ground truth. This methodology aids the network in continuously acquiring knowledge regarding the internal relationships among the sequences throughout the learning phase. Moreover, the introduction of textual labels is instrumental in categorizing images generated within the sequence. The empirical findings from the conducted experiments indicate that our proposed model not only effectively generates longitudinal data but also significantly improves the precision of downstream classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BIBM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Diff-CXR: Report-to-CXR generation through a disease-knowledge enhanced diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20165v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-To-Image (TTI) generation is significant for controlled and diverse image generation with broad potential applications. Although current medical TTI methods have made some progress in report-to-Chest-Xray (CXR) generation, their generation performance may be limited due to the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel disease-knowledge enhanced Diffusion-based TTI learning framework, named Diff-CXR, for medical report-to-CXR generation. First, to minimize the negative impacts of noisy data on generation, we devise a Latent Noise Filtering Strategy that gradually learns the general patterns of anomalies and removes them in the latent space. Then, an Adaptive Vision-Aware Textual Learning Strategy is designed to learn concise and important report embeddings in a domain-specific Vision-Language Model, providing textual guidance for Chest-Xray generation. Finally, by incorporating the general disease knowledge into the pretrained TTI model via a delicate control adapter, a disease-knowledge enhanced diffusion model is introduced to achieve realistic and precise report-to-CXR generation. Experimentally, our Diff-CXR outperforms previous SOTA medical TTI methods by 33.4\% / 8.0\% and 23.8\% / 56.4\% in the FID and mAUC score on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray, with the lowest computational complexity at 29.641 GFLOPs. Downstream experiments on three thorax disease classification benchmarks and one CXR-report generation benchmark demonstrate that Diff-CXR is effective in improving classical CXR analysis methods. Notably, models trained on the combination of 1\% real data and synthetic data can achieve a competitive mAUC score compared to models trained on all data, presenting promising clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Explanations for Medical Image Classification and Regression using Diffusion Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01571v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual explanations (CEs) aim to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models by illustrating how alterations in input features would affect the resulting predictions. Common CE approaches require an additional model and are typically constrained to binary counterfactuals. In contrast, we propose a novel method that operates directly on the latent space of a generative model, specifically a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE). This approach offers inherent interpretability by enabling the generation of CEs and the continuous visualization of the model's internal representation across decision boundaries. Our method leverages the DAE's ability to encode images into a semantically rich latent space in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled data or separate feature extraction models. We show that these latent representations are helpful for medical condition classification and the ordinal regression of severity pathologies, such as vertebral compression fractures (VCF) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Beyond binary CEs, our method supports the visualization of ordinal CEs using a linear model, providing deeper insights into the model's decision-making process and enhancing interpretability. Experiments across various medical imaging datasets demonstrate the method's advantages in interpretability and versatility. The linear manifold of the DAE's latent space allows for meaningful interpolation and manipulation, making it a powerful tool for exploring medical image properties.

| **[RadGazeGen: Radiomics and Gaze-guided Medical Image Generation using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00307v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present RadGazeGen, a novel framework for integrating experts' eye gaze patterns and radiomic feature maps as controls to text-to-image diffusion models for high fidelity medical image generation. Despite the recent success of text-to-image diffusion models, text descriptions are often found to be inadequate and fail to convey detailed disease-specific information to these models to generate clinically accurate images. The anatomy, disease texture patterns, and location of the disease are extremely important to generate realistic images; moreover the fidelity of image generation can have significant implications in downstream tasks involving disease diagnosis or treatment repose assessment. Hence, there is a growing need to carefully define the controls used in diffusion models for medical image generation. Eye gaze patterns of radiologists are important visuo-cognitive information, indicative of subtle disease patterns and spatial location. Radiomic features further provide important subvisual cues regarding disease phenotype. In this work, we propose to use these gaze patterns in combination with standard radiomics descriptors, as controls, to generate anatomically correct and disease-aware medical images. RadGazeGen is evaluated for image generation quality and diversity on the REFLACX dataset. To demonstrate clinical applicability, we also show classification performance on the generated images from the CheXpert test set (n=500) and long-tailed learning performance on the MIMIC-CXR-LT test set (n=23550).</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Imbalanced Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14313v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data often has a long-tailed distribution, where the scarcity of tail samples significantly limits the model's generalization ability. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are generative models based on stochastic differential equation theory and have demonstrated impressive performance in image classification tasks. However, existing diffusion probabilistic models do not perform satisfactorily in classifying tail classes. In this work, we propose the Anisotropic Diffusion Probabilistic Model (ADPM) for imbalanced image classification problems. We utilize the data distribution to control the diffusion speed of different class samples during the forward process, effectively improving the classification accuracy of the denoiser in the reverse process. Specifically, we provide a theoretical strategy for selecting noise levels for different categories in the diffusion process based on error analysis theory to address the imbalanced classification problem. Furthermore, we integrate global and local image prior in the forward process to enhance the model's discriminative ability in the spatial dimension, while incorporate semantic-level contextual information in the reverse process to boost the model's discriminative power and robustness. Through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on four medical benchmark datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling long-tail data. Our results confirm that the anisotropic diffusion model significantly improves the classification accuracy of rare classes while maintaining the accuracy of head classes. On the skin lesion datasets, PAD-UFES and HAM10000, the F1-scores of our method improved by 4% and 3%, respectively compared to the original diffusion probabilistic model.</p></details> |  |

While inference with these systems on consumer-grade GPUs is increasingly feasible, training from scratch requires large captioned datasets and significant computational resources. In medical image generation, the limited availability of large, publicly accessible datasets with text reports poses challenges due to legal and ethical concerns. This work shows that adapting pre-trained Stable Diffusion models to medical imaging modalities is achievable by training text embeddings using Textual Inversion. In this study, we experimented with small medical datasets (100 samples each from three modalities) and trained within hours to generate diagnostically accurate images, as judged by an expert radiologist. Experiments with Textual Inversion training and inference parameters reveal the necessity of larger embeddings and more examples in the medical domain. Classification experiments show an increase in diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, from 0.78 to 0.80. Further experiments demonstrate embedding flexibility through disease interpolation, combining pathologies, and inpainting for precise disease appearance control. The trained embeddings are compact (less than 1 MB), enabling easy data sharing with reduced privacy concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MIDL 2024</p></details> |

This distribution presents a significant challenge because rare conditions are critical to detect and difficult to classify due to limited data. In this paper, rather than attempting to classify rare classes, we aim to detect these as out-of-distribution data reliably. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem. We significantly improve the OOD detection performance on a challenging histopathological task with only ten samples per tail class without losing classification accuracy on the head classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving EEG Classification Through Randomly Reassembling Original and Generated Data with Transformer-based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20253v2)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has been widely used in various medical and engineering applications, where it is important for understanding brain function, diagnosing diseases, and assessing mental health conditions. However, the scarcity of EEG data severely restricts the performance of EEG classification networks, and generative model-based data augmentation methods have emerged as potential solutions to overcome this challenge. There are two problems with existing methods: (1) The quality of the generated EEG signals is not high; (2) The enhancement of EEG classification networks is not effective. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a generated data-based augmentation method to address the above two problems. For the characteristics of EEG signals, we propose a constant-factor scaling method to preprocess the signals, which reduces the loss of information. We incorporated Multi-Scale Convolution and Dynamic Fourier Spectrum Information modules into the model, improving the stability of the training process and the quality of the generated data. The proposed augmentation method randomly reassemble the generated data with original data in the time-domain to obtain vicinal data, which improves the model performance by minimizing the empirical risk and the vicinal risk. We verify the proposed augmentation method on four EEG datasets for four tasks and observe significant accuracy performance improvements: 14.00% on the Bonn dataset; 6.38% on the SleepEDF-20 dataset; 9.42% on the FACED dataset; 2.5% on the Shu dataset. We will make the code of our method publicly accessible soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Evolution of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Diffusion-based Morphing Model for X-ray Medical Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00891v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that significantly affects the mobility of older adults. In the medical domain, images containing temporal data are frequently utilized to study temporal dynamics and statistically monitor disease progression. While deep learning-based generative models for natural images have been widely researched, there are comparatively few methods available for synthesizing temporal knee X-rays. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning model designed to synthesize intermediate X-ray images between a specific patient's healthy knee and severe KOA stages. During the testing phase, based on a healthy knee X-ray, the proposed model can produce a continuous and effective sequence of KOA X-ray images with varying degrees of severity. Specifically, we introduce a Diffusion-based Morphing Model by modifying the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Our approach integrates diffusion and morphing modules, enabling the model to capture spatial morphing details between source and target knee X-ray images and synthesize intermediate frames along a geodesic path. A hybrid loss consisting of diffusion loss, morphing loss, and supervision loss was employed. We demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the highest temporal frame synthesis performance, effectively augmenting data for classification models and simulating the progression of KOA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Sample Quality via the Latent Space of Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15171v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in generative models increase the need for sample quality assessment. To do so, previous methods rely on a pre-trained feature extractor to embed the generated samples and real samples into a common space for comparison. However, different feature extractors might lead to inconsistent assessment outcomes. Moreover, these methods are not applicable for domains where a robust, universal feature extractor does not yet exist, such as medical images or 3D assets. In this paper, we propose to directly examine the latent space of the trained generative model to infer generated sample quality. This is feasible because the quality a generated sample directly relates to the amount of training data resembling it, and we can infer this information by examining the density of the latent space. Accordingly, we use a latent density score function to quantify sample quality. We show that the proposed score correlates highly with the sample quality for various generative models including VAEs, GANs and Latent Diffusion Models. Compared with previous quality assessment methods, our method has the following advantages: 1) pre-generation quality estimation with reduced computational cost, 2) generalizability to various domains and modalities, and 3) applicability to latent-based image editing and generation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods can benefit downstream tasks such as few-shot image classification and latent face image editing.

While generative models excel at creating new data patterns, they face challenges such as mode collapse in GANs and difficulties in training diffusion models, especially with limited medical imaging data. On the other hand, mixture models enhance class boundary regions but tend to favor the major class in scenarios with class imbalance. To address these limitations, GenMix integrates both approaches to complement each other. GenMix operates in two stages: (1) training a generative model to produce synthetic images, and (2) performing mixup between synthetic and real data. This process improves the quality and diversity of synthetic data while simultaneously benefiting from the new pattern learning of generative models and the boundary enhancement of mixture models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) in CT images. Our results demonstrate that GenMix enhances the performance of various generative models, including DCGAN, StyleGAN, Textual Inversion, and Diffusion Models. Notably, the proposed method with Textual Inversion outperforms other methods without fine-tuning diffusion model on the FLL dataset.</p></details> |  |

Scaling Medical Diffusion via Self-Supervised Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11594v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful foundation models for a variety of tasks, with a large focus in synthetic image generation. However, their requirement of large annotated datasets for training limits their applicability in medical imaging, where datasets are typically smaller and sparsely annotated. We introduce DiNO-Diffusion, a self-supervised method for training latent diffusion models (LDMs) that conditions the generation process on image embeddings extracted from DiNO. By eliminating the reliance on annotations, our training leverages over 868k unlabelled images from public chest X-Ray (CXR) datasets. Despite being self-supervised, DiNO-Diffusion shows comprehensive manifold coverage, with FID scores as low as 4.7, and emerging properties when evaluated in downstream tasks. It can be used to generate semantically-diverse synthetic datasets even from small data pools, demonstrating up to 20% AUC increase in classification performance when used for data augmentation. Images were generated with different sampling strategies over the DiNO embedding manifold and using real images as a starting point. Results suggest, DiNO-Diffusion could facilitate the creation of large datasets for flexible training of downstream AI models from limited amount of real data, while also holding potential for privacy preservation. Additionally, DiNO-Diffusion demonstrates zero-shot segmentation performance of up to 84.4% Dice score when evaluating lung lobe segmentation. This evidences good CXR image-anatomy alignment, akin to segmenting using textual descriptors on vanilla DMs. Finally, DiNO-Diffusion can be easily adapted to other medical imaging modalities or state-of-the-art diffusion models, opening the door for large-scale, multi-domain image generation pipelines for medical imaging.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Without directly comparable methods in 3D medical imaging, we benchmarked GenerateCT against cutting-edge methods, demonstrating its superiority across all key metrics. Importantly, we evaluated GenerateCT's clinical applications in a multi-abnormality classification task. First, we established a baseline by training a multi-abnormality classifier on our real dataset. To further assess the model's generalization to external data and performance with unseen prompts in a zero-shot scenario, we employed an external set to train the classifier, setting an additional benchmark. We conducted two experiments in which we doubled the training datasets by synthesizing an equal number of volumes for each set using GenerateCT. The first experiment demonstrated an 11% improvement in the AP score when training the classifier jointly on real and generated volumes. The second experiment showed a 7% improvement when training on both real and generated volumes based on unseen prompts. Moreover, GenerateCT enables the scaling of synthetic training datasets to arbitrary sizes. As an example, we generated 100,000 3D CTs, fivefold the number in our real set, and trained the classifier exclusively on these synthetic CTs. Impressively, this classifier surpassed the performance of the one trained on all available real data by a margin of 8%. Last, domain experts evaluated the generated volumes, confirming a high degree of alignment with the text prompt.

As deep learning techniques prove successful in the medical domain, the primary challenges become limited data availability and concerns about data sharing and privacy. Federated learning has addressed this challenge by training models locally and updating parameters on a server. However, issues, such as domain shift and bias, persist and impact overall performance. Dataset distillation presents an alternative approach to overcoming these challenges. It involves creating a small synthetic dataset that encapsulates essential information, which can be shared without constraints. At present, this paradigm is not practicable as current distillation approaches only generate non human readable representations and exhibit insufficient performance for downstream learning tasks. We train a latent diffusion model and construct a new distilled synthetic dataset with a small number of human readable synthetic images. Selection of maximally informative synthetic images is done via graph community analysis of the representation space. We compare downstream classification models trained on our synthetic distillation data to models trained on real data and reach performances suitable for practical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

For classification, we divide the whole surface DUV image into small patches and extract convolutional features for each patch by utilizing the pre-trained ResNet. Then, we feed them into an XGBoost classifier for patch-level decisions and then fuse them with a regional importance map computed by Grad-CAM++ for whole surface-level prediction.

While Vision Transformer has shown superior performance over convolutional neural networks in image classification tasks, their effectiveness is often demonstrated on sufficiently large 2D datasets and they easily encounter overfitting issues on small medical image datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a Diffusion-based 3D Vision Transformer (Diff3Dformer), which utilizes the latent space of the Diffusion model to form the slice sequence for 3D analysis and incorporates clustering attention into ViT to aggregate repetitive information within 3D CT scans, thereby harnessing the power of the advanced transformer in 3D classification tasks on small datasets. Our method exhibits improved performance on two different scales of small datasets of 3D lung CT scans, surpassing the state of the art 3D methods and other transformer-based approaches that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its robust and superior performance across different scales of data. Experimental results underscore the superiority of our proposed method, indicating its potential for enhancing medical image classification tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | conference |

Methods: This paper proposes the Guided Conditional Diffusion Classifier (ConDiff), a novel deep-learning infection detection model that combines guided image synthesis with a denoising diffusion model and distance-based classification. The process involves (1) generating guided conditional synthetic images by injecting Gaussian noise to a guide image, followed by denoising the noise-perturbed image through a reverse diffusion process, conditioned on infection status and (2) classifying infections based on the minimum Euclidean distance between synthesized images and the original guide image in embedding space. Results: ConDiff demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 83% and an F1-score of 0.858, outperforming state-of-the-art models by at least 3%.

Diffusion models facilitate high-fidelity medical image generation, reducing the costs associated with acquiring and annotating new images. This paper utilizes recent vision-language models to produce diverse and realistic synthetic echocardiography image data, preserving key features of the original images guided by textual and semantic label maps. Specifically, we investigate three potential avenues: unconditional generation, generation guided by text, and a hybrid approach incorporating both textual and semantic supervision. We show that the rich contextual information present in the synthesized data potentially enhances the accuracy and interpretability of downstream tasks, such as echocardiography segmentation and classification with improved metrics and faster convergence. Our implementation with checkpoints, prompts, and the created synthetic dataset will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/Pooria90/DiffEcho}{GitHub}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted as a conference paper to MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Iterative Online Image Synthesis via Diffusion Model for Imbalanced Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08407v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust classification of diseases is important for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, medical datasets often face challenges related to limited sample sizes and inherent imbalanced distributions, due to difficulties in data collection and variations in disease prevalence across different types. In this paper, we introduce an Iterative Online Image Synthesis (IOIS) framework to address the class imbalance problem in medical image classification. Our framework incorporates two key modules, namely Online Image Synthesis (OIS) and Accuracy Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which collectively target the imbalance classification issue at both the instance level and the class level. The OIS module alleviates the data insufficiency problem by generating representative samples tailored for online training of the classifier. On the other hand, the AAS module dynamically balances the synthesized samples among various classes, targeting those with low training accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method in addressing imbalanced classification, we conduct experiments on the HAM10000 and APTOS datasets. The results obtained demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods as well as the effectiveness of each component. The source code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02682v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (weather, location, etc.). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata, and its heterogeneity poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce Time Weaver, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that Time Weaver outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 27% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion of Diffusion Weighted MRI and Clinical Data for Predicting Functional Outcome after Acute Ischemic Stroke with Deep Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10894v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stroke is a common disabling neurological condition that affects about one-quarter of the adult population over age 25; more than half of patients still have poor outcomes, such as permanent functional dependence or even death, after the onset of acute stroke. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted MRI modalities combining with structured health profile on predicting the functional outcome to facilitate early intervention. A deep fusion learning network is proposed with two-stage training: the first stage focuses on cross-modality representation learning and the second stage on classification. Supervised contrastive learning is exploited to learn discriminative features that separate the two classes of patients from embeddings of individual modalities and from the fused multimodal embedding. The network takes as the input DWI and ADC images, and structured health profile data. The outcome is the prediction of the patient needing long-term care at 3 months after the onset of stroke. Trained and evaluated with a dataset of 3297 patients, our proposed fusion model achieves 0.87, 0.80 and 80.45% for AUC, F1-score and accuracy, respectively, outperforming existing models that consolidate both imaging and structured data in the medical domain. If trained with comprehensive clinical variables, including NIHSS and comorbidities, the gain from images on making accurate prediction is not considered substantial, but significant. However, diffusion-weighted MRI can replace NIHSS to achieve comparable level of accuracy combining with other readily available clinical variables for better generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a noncontact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used. The final classification maps obtained have been analyzed and validated by specialists. These preliminary results are promising, obtaining an accurate delineation of the tumor area.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing computer-aided skin cancer classification systems employ deep learning approaches. However, recent studies reveal their extreme vulnerability to adversarial attacks -- often imperceptible perturbations to significantly reduce the performances of skin cancer diagnosis models. To mitigate these threats, this work presents a simple, effective, and resource-efficient defense framework by reverse engineering adversarial perturbations in skin cancer images. Specifically, a multiscale image pyramid is first established to better preserve discriminative structures in the medical imaging domain. To neutralize adversarial effects, skin images at different scales are then progressively diffused by injecting isotropic Gaussian noises to move the adversarial examples to the clean image manifold. Crucially, to further reverse adversarial noises and suppress redundant injected noises, a novel multiscale denoising mechanism is carefully designed that aggregates image information from neighboring scales. We evaluated the defensive effectiveness of our method on ISIC 2019, a largest skin cancer multiclass classification dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully reverse adversarial perturbations from different attacks and significantly outperform some state-of-the-art methods in defending skin cancer diagnosis models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

However, traditional data gathering methods are too slow for these scenarios necessitating innovative approaches to generate reliable models quickly from minimal data. We demonstrate our new approach by building a comprehensive computer vision model for detecting Human Papilloma Virus Genital warts using only synthetic data. In our study, we employed a two phase experimental design using diffusion models. In the first phase diffusion models were utilized to generate a large number of diverse synthetic images from 10 HPV guide images explicitly focusing on accurately depicting genital warts. The second phase involved the training and testing vision model using this synthetic dataset. This method aimed to assess the effectiveness of diffusion models in rapidly generating high quality training data and the subsequent impact on the vision model performance in medical image recognition. The study findings revealed significant insights into the performance of the vision model trained on synthetic images generated through diffusion models. The vision model showed exceptional performance in accurately identifying cases of genital warts. It achieved an accuracy rate of 96% underscoring its effectiveness in medical image classification. For HPV cases the model demonstrated a high precision of 99% and a recall of 94%. In normal cases the precision was 95% with an impressive recall of 99%. These metrics indicate the model capability to correctly identify true positive cases and minimize false positives. The model achieved an F1 Score of 96% for HPV cases and 97% for normal cases. The high F1 Score across both categories highlights the balanced nature of the model precision and recall ensuring reliability and robustness in its predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages 5 figures 1 table</p></details> |

Open-source medical datasets, while valuable, suffer from data quality and clinical information disparities. Generative models, such as diffusion models, aim to mitigate these challenges. At Stanford, researchers explored the utility of a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model (RoentGen) for medical imaging data augmentation. Our work examines specific considerations to expand the Stanford research question, Could Stable Diffusion Solve a Gap in Medical Imaging Data? from the lens of bias and validity of the generated outcomes. We leveraged RoentGen to produce synthetic Chest-XRay (CXR) images and conducted assessments on bias, validity, and hallucinations. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by a disease classifier, while a COVID classifier uncovered latent hallucinations. The bias analysis unveiled disparities in classification performance among various subgroups, with a pronounced impact on the Female Hispanic subgroup. Furthermore, incorporating race and gender into input prompts exacerbated fairness issues in the generated images. The quality of synthetic images exhibited variability, particularly in certain disease classes, where there was more significant uncertainty compared to the original images. Additionally, we observed latent hallucinations, with approximately 42% of the images incorrectly indicating COVID, hinting at the presence of hallucinatory elements. These identifications provide new research directions towards interpretability of synthetic CXR images, for further understanding of associated risks and patient safety in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) - "Medical Imaging Meets NeurIPS" Workshop</p></details> |

However, the need for annotated medical images is often an obstacle to leveraging the full power of machine learning models. Our research demonstrates that by combining synthetic images, generated using diffusion models, with real images, we can enhance nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) classification performance even in low-data regime settings. We evaluate the quality of the synthetic images by comparing two metrics: Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID), computed on diffusion- and generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated images. Our results show superior performance for the diffusion-generated images, with a maximum IS score of $1.90$ compared to $1.67$ for GANs, and a minimum FID score of $69.45$ compared to $100.05$ for GANs. Utilizing a partially frozen CNN backbone (EfficientNet v1), our synthetic augmentation method achieves a maximum image-level ROC AUC of $0.904$ on a NAFLD prediction task.</p></details> | 36 pages, 13 figures |

However, their use for sequential data like respiratory sounds is less explored. In this work, we propose a straightforward approach to augment imbalanced respiratory sound data using an audio diffusion model as a conditional neural vocoder. We also demonstrate a simple yet effective adversarial fine-tuning method to align features between the synthetic and real respiratory sound samples to improve respiratory sound classification performance. Our experimental results on the ICBHI dataset demonstrate that the proposed adversarial fine-tuning is effective, while only using the conventional augmentation method shows performance degradation. Moreover, our method outperforms the baseline by 2.24% on the ICBHI Score and improves the accuracy of the minority classes up to 26.58%.

However, real DFU datasets are limited, hindering clinical training and research activities. In recent years, generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating synthetic images with remarkable realism and diversity in many applications. This paper explores the potential of diffusion models for synthesizing DFU images and evaluates their authenticity through expert clinician assessments. Additionally, evaluation metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) are examined to assess the quality of the synthetic DFU images. A dataset of 2,000 DFU images is used for training the diffusion model, and the synthetic images are generated by applying diffusion processes. The results indicate that the diffusion model successfully synthesizes visually indistinguishable DFU images. 70% of the time, clinicians marked synthetic DFU images as real DFUs. However, clinicians demonstrate higher unanimous confidence in rating real images than synthetic ones. The study also reveals that FID and KID metrics do not significantly align with clinicians' assessments, suggesting alternative evaluation approaches are needed. The findings highlight the potential of diffusion models for generating synthetic DFU images and their impact on medical training programs and research in wound detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 6th Workshop on AI for Aging, Rehabilitation and Intelligent Assisted Living at European Conference on Machine Learning, Italy, 2023</p></details> |

However, existing models struggle with complex relationships and characteristics of spectral-spatial data due to the multi-band nature and data redundancy of hyperspectral data. To address this limitation, we propose a new network called DiffSpectralNet, which combines diffusion and transformer techniques. Our approach involves a two-step process. First, we use an unsupervised learning framework based on the diffusion model to extract both high-level and low-level spectral-spatial features. The diffusion method is capable of extracting diverse and meaningful spectral-spatial features, leading to improvement in HSI classification. Then, we employ a pretrained denoising U-Net to extract intermediate hierarchical features for classification. Finally, we use a supervised transformer-based classifier to perform the HSI classification. Through comprehensive experiments on HSI datasets, we evaluate the classification performance of DiffSpectralNet. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We may therefore increase the interpretability of deep learning models by imbuing them with a similar style of reasoning. In this work, we apply this principle by classifying Alzheimer's Disease based on the similarity of images to training examples within the latent space. We use a contrastive loss combined with a diffusion autoencoder backbone, to produce a semantically meaningful latent space, such that neighbouring latents have similar image-level features. We achieve a classification accuracy comparable to black box approaches on a dataset of 2D MRI images, whilst producing human interpretable model explanations. Therefore, this work stands as a contribution to the pertinent development of accurate and interpretable deep learning within medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

However, similar to classification models, segmentation models are affected by adversarial attacks. In a safety-critical field like healthcare, certifying model predictions is of the utmost importance. Randomized smoothing has been introduced lately and provides a framework to certify models and obtain theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we present for the first time a certified segmentation baseline for medical imaging based on randomized smoothing and diffusion models. Our results show that leveraging the power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models helps us overcome the limits of randomized smoothing. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets of chest X-rays, skin lesions, and colonoscopies, and empirically show that we are able to maintain high certified Dice scores even for highly perturbed images. Our work represents the first attempt to certify medical image segmentation models, and we aspire for it to set a foundation for future benchmarks in this crucial and largely uncharted area.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIE: Simulating Disease Progression via Progressive Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11745v2)** | 2023-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disease progression simulation is a crucial area of research that has significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from 35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2% of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to model disease trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and checkpoints for replicating our results can be found at https://github.com/IrohXu/PIE and https://huggingface.co/IrohXu/stable-diffusion-mimic-cxr-v0.1</p></details> |

Current techniques for evaluating deep learning models cannot visualize confounding factors at a diagnostic level. Here, we propose a self-conditioned diffusion model termed DiffChest and train it on a dataset of 515,704 chest radiographs from 194,956 patients from multiple healthcare centers in the United States and Europe. DiffChest explains classifications on a patient-specific level and visualizes the confounding factors that may mislead the model. We found high inter-reader agreement when evaluating DiffChest's capability to identify treatment-related confounders, with Fleiss' Kappa values of 0.8 or higher across most imaging findings. Confounders were accurately captured with 11.1% to 100% prevalence rates. Furthermore, our pretraining process optimized the model to capture the most relevant information from the input radiographs. DiffChest achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy when diagnosing 11 chest conditions, such as pleural effusion and cardiac insufficiency, and at least sufficient diagnostic accuracy for the remaining conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of pretraining based on diffusion models in medical image classification, specifically in providing insights into confounding factors and model robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Structural and Functional Connectivities using Disentangled VAE for Detecting MCI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09629v2)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain network analysis is a useful approach to studying human brain disorders because it can distinguish patients from healthy people by detecting abnormal connections. Due to the complementary information from multiple modal neuroimages, multimodal fusion technology has a lot of potential for improving prediction performance. However, effective fusion of multimodal medical images to achieve complementarity is still a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel hierarchical structural-functional connectivity fusing (HSCF) model is proposed to construct brain structural-functional connectivity matrices and predict abnormal brain connections based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Specifically, the prior knowledge is incorporated into the separators for disentangling each modality of information by the graph convolutional networks (GCN). And a disentangled cosine distance loss is devised to ensure the disentanglement's effectiveness. Moreover, the hierarchical representation fusion module is designed to effectively maximize the combination of relevant and effective features between modalities, which makes the generated structural-functional connectivity more robust and discriminative in the cognitive disease analysis. Results from a wide range of tests performed on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database show that the proposed model performs better than competing approaches in terms of classification evaluation. In general, the proposed HSCF model is a promising model for generating brain structural-functional connectivities and identifying abnormal brain connections as cognitive disease progresses.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Synthetic Augmentation with Large-scale Unconditional Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04020v1)** | 2023-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based medical image recognition systems often require a substantial amount of training data with expert annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Recently, synthetic augmentation techniques have been proposed to mitigate the issue by generating realistic images conditioned on class labels. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the representation capability of the trained generative model, which cannot be guaranteed without sufficient labeled training data. To further reduce the dependency on annotated data, we propose a synthetic augmentation method called HistoDiffusion, which can be pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and later applied to a small-scale labeled dataset for augmented training. In particular, we train a latent diffusion model (LDM) on diverse unlabeled datasets to learn common features and generate realistic images without conditional inputs. Then, we fine-tune the model with classifier guidance in latent space on an unseen labeled dataset so that the model can synthesize images of specific categories. Additionally, we adopt a selective mechanism to only add synthetic samples with high confidence of matching to target labels. We evaluate our proposed method by pre-training on three histopathology datasets and testing on a histopathology dataset of colorectal cancer (CRC) excluded from the pre-training datasets. With HistoDiffusion augmentation, the classification accuracy of a backbone classifier is remarkably improved by 6.4% using a small set of the original labels. Our code is available at https://github.com/karenyyy/HistoDiffAug.</p></details> | MICCAI 2023 |

Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

Increasing diagnosis accessibility requires fair and accurate segmentation and classification of dermatology images. However, the scarcity of annotated medical images, especially for rare diseases and underrepresented skin tones, poses a challenge to the development of fair and accurate models. In this study, we introduce a Fair, Efficient, and Diverse Diffusion-based framework for skin lesion segmentation and malignancy classification. FEDD leverages semantically meaningful feature embeddings learned through a denoising diffusion probabilistic backbone and processes them via linear probes to achieve state-of-the-art performance on Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). We achieve an improvement in intersection over union of 0.18, 0.13, 0.06, and 0.07 while using only 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% labeled samples, respectively. Additionally, FEDD trained on 10% of DDI demonstrates malignancy classification accuracy of 81%, 14% higher compared to the state-of-the-art. We showcase high efficiency in data-constrained scenarios while providing fair performance for diverse skin tones and rare malignancy conditions.

However, while a substantial amount of diffusion-based research has focused on generative tasks, few studies have applied diffusion models to general medical image classification. In this paper, we propose the first diffusion-based model (named DiffMIC) to address general medical image classification by eliminating unexpected noise and perturbations in medical images and robustly capturing semantic representation. To achieve this goal, we devise a dual conditional guidance strategy that conditions each diffusion step with multiple granularities to improve step-wise regional attention. Furthermore, we propose learning the mutual information in each granularity by enforcing Maximum-Mean Discrepancy regularization during the diffusion forward process. We evaluate the effectiveness of our DiffMIC on three medical classification tasks with different image modalities, including placental maturity grading on ultrasound images, skin lesion classification using dermatoscopic images, and diabetic retinopathy grading using fundus images. Our experimental results demonstrate that DiffMIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, indicating the universality and effectiveness of the proposed model.

In this work, we show the capacity of MIM to capture rich semantic representations of Haemotoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained images at the nuclear level. Inspired by Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers (BEiT), we split the images into smaller patches and generate corresponding discrete visual tokens. In addition to the regular grid-based patches, typically used in visual Transformers, we introduce patches of individual cell nuclei. We propose positional encoding of the irregular distribution of these structures within an image. We pre-train the model in a self-supervised manner on H&E-stained whole-slide images of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where cell nuclei have been segmented. The pre-training objective is to recover the original discrete visual tokens of the masked image on the one hand, and to reconstruct the visual tokens of the masked object instances on the other. Coupling these two pre-training tasks allows us to build powerful, context-aware representations of nuclei. Our model generalizes well and can be fine-tuned on downstream classification tasks, achieving improved cell classification accuracy on PanNuke dataset by more than 5% compared to current instance segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

Due to ethical concerns, obtaining sufficient medical data for machine learning is a challenge, which our approach aims to address by synthesising more data. We utilised the Chest X-ray 14 dataset for our experiments and evaluated the performance of our models through qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our results show that the generated images are visually convincing and can be used to improve the accuracy of classification models. However, further work is needed to address issues such as overfitting and the limited availability of real data for training and testing. The potential of our approach to contribute to more effective medical diagnosis through deep learning is promising, and we believe that continued advancements in image generation technology will lead to even more promising results in the future.</p></details> |  |

In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed and trained for classifying different subtypes of RCC using ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a dataset of RCC histopathology images, which consisted of digital images of RCC surgical resection slides that were annotated with the corresponding subtype labels. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, in this research, a novel synthetic image generation tool, NephroNet, is developed on diffusion models that are used to generate original images of RCC surgical resection slides. Diffusion models are a class of generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from noise. Several diffusers such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth Text-to-Image, and Textual Inversion were trained on a dataset of RCC images and were used to generate a series of original images that resembled RCC surgical resection slides, all within the span of fewer than four seconds. The generated images were visually realistic and could be used for creating new training datasets, testing the performance of image analysis algorithms, and training medical professionals. NephroNet is provided as an open-source software package and contains files for data preprocessing, training, and visualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence and diffusion models for classifying and generating RCC images, respectively. These methods could be useful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of RCC and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, labeled training data for real-world applications such as healthcare is limited and difficult to access given longstanding privacy, and strict data sharing policies. By manipulating image datasets in the pixel or feature space, existing data augmentation techniques represent one of the effective ways to improve the quantity and diversity of training data. Here, we look to advance augmentation techniques by building upon the emerging success of text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models in augmenting the training samples of our macroscopic skin disease dataset. We do so by enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process via input text prompts. We demonstrate that this generative data augmentation approach successfully maintains a similar classification accuracy of the visual classifier even when trained on a fully synthetic skin disease dataset. Similar to recent applications of generative models, our study suggests that diffusion models are indeed effective in generating high-quality skin images that do not sacrifice the classifier performance, and can improve the augmentation of training datasets after curation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation of Anonymous Chest Radiographs Using Latent Diffusion Models for Training Thoracic Abnormality Classification Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01323v2)** | 2022-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of large-scale chest X-ray datasets is a requirement for developing well-performing deep learning-based algorithms in thoracic abnormality detection and classification. However, biometric identifiers in chest radiographs hinder the public sharing of such data for research purposes due to the risk of patient re-identification. To counteract this issue, synthetic data generation offers a solution for anonymizing medical images. This work employs a latent diffusion model to synthesize an anonymous chest X-ray dataset of high-quality class-conditional images. We propose a privacy-enhancing sampling strategy to ensure the non-transference of biometric information during the image generation process. The quality of the generated images and the feasibility of serving as exclusive training data are evaluated on a thoracic abnormality classification task. Compared to a real classifier, we achieve competitive results with a performance gap of only 3.5% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Automatic Identification of Claim Spans on Twitter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04710v2)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread diffusion of medical and political claims in the wake of COVID-19 has led to a voluminous rise in misinformation and fake news. The current vogue is to employ manual fact-checkers to efficiently classify and verify such data to combat this avalanche of claim-ridden misinformation. However, the rate of information dissemination is such that it vastly outpaces the fact-checkers' strength. Therefore, to aid manual fact-checkers in eliminating the superfluous content, it becomes imperative to automatically identify and extract the snippets of claim-worthy (mis)information present in a post. In this work, we introduce the novel task of Claim Span Identification (CSI). We propose CURT, a large-scale Twitter corpus with token-level claim spans on more than 7.5k tweets. Furthermore, along with the standard token classification baselines, we benchmark our dataset with DABERTa, an adapter-based variation of RoBERTa. The experimental results attest that DABERTa outperforms the baseline systems across several evaluation metrics, improving by about 1.5 points. We also report detailed error analysis to validate the model's performance along with the ablation studies. Lastly, we release our comprehensive span annotation guidelines for public use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP22. 16 pages including Appendix</p></details> |
| **[PainPoints: A Framework for Language-based Detection of Chronic Pain and Expert-Collaborative Text-Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09814v1)** | 2022-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic pain is a pervasive disorder which is often very disabling and is associated with comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. Neuropathic Pain (NP) is a common sub-type which is often caused due to nerve damage and has a known pathophysiology. Another common sub-type is Fibromyalgia (FM) which is described as musculoskeletal, diffuse pain that is widespread through the body. The pathophysiology of FM is poorly understood, making it very hard to diagnose. Standard medications and treatments for FM and NP differ from one another and if misdiagnosed it can cause an increase in symptom severity. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel framework, PainPoints, which accurately detects the sub-type of pain and generates clinical notes via summarizing the patient interviews. Specifically, PainPoints makes use of large language models to perform sentence-level classification of the text obtained from interviews of FM and NP patients with a reliable AUC of 0.83. Using a sufficiency-based interpretability approach, we explain how the fine-tuned model accurately picks up on the nuances that patients use to describe their pain. Finally, we generate summaries of these interviews via expert interventions by introducing a novel facet-based approach. PainPoints thus enables practitioners to add/drop facets and generate a custom summary based on the notion of "facet-coverage" which is also introduced in this work.</p></details> |  |

| **[UniVid: Unifying Vision Tasks with Pre-trained Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21760v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISION: Prompting Ocean Vertical Velocity Reconstruction from Incomplete Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21477v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields, from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising. Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/YuanGao-YG/VISION.</p></details> |  |
| **[EndoBench: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Endoscopy Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23601v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing and treating internal diseases, and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied to assist in endoscopy analysis. However, current benchmarks are limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks, and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition, lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios. We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity. EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 22 figures; Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Dataset and Benchmark Track</p></details> |
| **[Robust RGB-T Tracking via Learnable Visual Fourier Prompt Fine-tuning and Modality Fusion Prompt Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19733v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features. Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally, unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our method demonstrates outstanding performance.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM2025 |
| **[HyPSAM: Hybrid Prompt-driven Segment Anything Model for RGB-Thermal Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18738v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains, thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The code and results of our method are available at: https://github.com/milotic233/HyPSAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniPixel: Unified Object Referring and Segmentation for Pixel-Level Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18094v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready.

While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation.

However, their direct transfer to remote sensing (RS) is hindered by heterogeneous sensing physics, diverse modalities, and unique spatial scales. Existing RS MLLMs are mainly limited to optical imagery and plain language interaction, preventing flexible and scalable real-world applications. In this article, EarthGPT-X is proposed, the first flexible spatial MLLM that unifies multi-source RS imagery comprehension and accomplishes both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual tasks under diverse visual prompts in a single framework. Distinct from prior models, EarthGPT-X introduces: 1) a dual-prompt mechanism combining text instructions with various visual prompts (i.e., point, box, and free-form) to mimic the versatility of referring in human life; 2) a comprehensive multi-source multi-level prompting dataset, the model advances beyond holistic image understanding to support hierarchical spatial reasoning, including scene-level understanding and fine-grained object attributes and relational analysis; 3) a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy, enabling efficient and consistent alignment across modalities and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthGPT-X substantially outperforms prior nature and RS MLLMs, establishing the first framework capable of multi-source, multi-task, and multi-level interpretation using visual prompting in RS scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[FC-Attack: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Auto-Generated Flowcharts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21059v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most MLLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, MLLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute the jailbreak attack on MLLMs. Our evaluations on Advbench show that FC-Attack attains an attack success rate of up to 96% via images and up to 78% via videos across multiple MLLMs. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. We also find that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepCaM++: Exploring Transparent Visual Prompt With Inference-Time Re-Parameterization for Neural Video Delivery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14002v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, content-aware methods have been employed to reduce bandwidth and enhance the quality of Internet video delivery. These methods involve training distinct content-aware super-resolution (SR) models for each video chunk on the server, subsequently streaming the low-resolution (LR) video chunks with the SR models to the client. Prior research has incorporated additional partial parameters to customize the models for individual video chunks. However, this leads to parameter accumulation and can fail to adapt appropriately as video lengths increase, resulting in increased delivery costs and reduced performance. In this paper, we introduce RepCaM++, an innovative framework based on a novel Re-parameterization Content-aware Modulation (RepCaM) module that uniformly modulates video chunks. The RepCaM framework integrates extra parallel-cascade parameters during training to accommodate multiple chunks, subsequently eliminating these additional parameters through re-parameterization during inference. Furthermore, to enhance RepCaM's performance, we propose the Transparent Visual Prompt (TVP), which includes a minimal set of zero-initialized image-level parameters (e.g., less than 0.1%) to capture fine details within video chunks. We conduct extensive experiments on the VSD4K dataset, encompassing six different video scenes, and achieve state-of-the-art results in video restoration quality and delivery bandwidth compression.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) for the accurate detection and classification of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods: We propose an end-to-end CAD pipeline consisting of two modules: (i) a detection module (CADe) based on the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in which the standard visual prompt is replaced with a text prompt encoded by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and (ii) a diagnosis module (CADx) that calculates similarity scores between segmented nodules and radiomic features. To add clinical context, synthetic electronic medical records (EMRs) were generated using radiomic assessments by expert radiologists and combined with similarity scores for final classification. The method was tested on the publicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset (1,018 CT scans). Results: The proposed approach demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot lung nodule analysis. The CADe module achieved a Dice score of 0.92 and an IoU of 0.85 for nodule segmentation. The CADx module attained a specificity of 0.97 for malignancy classification, surpassing existing fully supervised methods. Conclusions: The integration of VLMs with radiomics and synthetic EMRs allows for accurate and clinically relevant CAD of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. The proposed system shows strong potential to enhance early lung cancer detection, increase diagnostic confidence, and improve patient management in routine clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |

We constructed a database of approximately 3,000 anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a `Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task, a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025 MLLMCP Workshop</p></details> |

Recently, most efforts in the video detailed captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning, which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning, and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption. Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency. Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference stage. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |

Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference, these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image." Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level vision tasks.

In this work, we investigated three variants of adapting the pathology foundation model UNI2 for the MIDOG2025 Track 2 challenge: (1) LoRA + UNI2, (2) VPT + UNI2 + Vahadane Normalizer, and (3) VPT + UNI2 + GRL + Stain TTA. We observed that the integration of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) with stain normalization techniques contributed to improved generalization. The best robustness was achieved by further incorporating test-time augmentation (TTA) with Vahadane and Macenko stain normalization. Our final submission achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8837 and an ROC-AUC of 0.9513 on the preliminary leaderboard, ranking within the top 10 teams. These results suggest that prompt-based adaptation combined with stain-normalization TTA offers a promising strategy for atypical mitosis classification under diverse imaging conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Optimal Prompt Ensemble for Multi-source Visual Prompt Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12311v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly for resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge. However, naive aggregation often overlooks different source prompts have different contribution potential to the target task. To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns optimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an information-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient conflicts via a novel regularization strategy. Specifically, we propose a differentiable prompt transferability metric to captures the discriminability of prompt-induced features on the target task. Meanwhile, HGPrompt match the gradient variances with respect to different source prompts based on Hessian and Fisher Information, ensuring stable and coherent knowledge transfer while suppressing gradient conflicts among them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HGPrompt, validating its effectiveness in learning an optimal ensemble for effective multi-source prompt transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training, while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing} strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model, further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | ACM MM25 |

After training, only the prompts are shared by the clients with the central server for aggregation. However, textual prompt tuning suffers from overfitting to known concepts, limiting its generalizability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on multimodal contextual information - derived from the input image and textual attribute features of a class. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer module that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through a cross-attention mechanism. The dynamically generated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder of CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a consistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets, spanning three generalization settings, demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance on in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher generalizability to unseen classes and domains, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin of +1.57% - 2.26%.

Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJCAI2025 Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel zero-shot image matting model, called ZIM, with two key contributions: First, we develop a label converter that transforms segmentation labels into detailed matte labels, constructing the new SA1B-Matte dataset without costly manual annotations. Training SAM with this dataset enables it to generate precise matte masks while maintaining its zero-shot capability. Second, we design the zero-shot matting model equipped with a hierarchical pixel decoder to enhance mask representation, along with a prompt-aware masked attention mechanism to improve performance by enabling the model to focus on regions specified by visual prompts. We evaluate ZIM using the newly introduced MicroMat-3K test set, which contains high-quality micro-level matte labels. Experimental results show that ZIM outperforms existing methods in fine-grained mask generation and zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of ZIM in various downstream tasks requiring precise masks, such as image inpainting and 3D NeRF. Our contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing zero-shot matting and its downstream applications across a wide range of computer vision tasks.

| **[Towards Instance-wise Personalized Federated Learning via Semi-Implicit Bayesian Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19621v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training across multiple distributed clients without disclosing their raw data. Personalized federated learning (pFL) has gained increasing attention for its ability to address data heterogeneity. However, most existing pFL methods assume that each client's data follows a single distribution and learn one client-level personalized model for each client. This assumption often fails in practice, where a single client may possess data from multiple sources or domains, resulting in significant intra-client heterogeneity and suboptimal performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise pFL framework based on visual prompt tuning. Specifically, we formulate instance-wise prompt generation from a Bayesian perspective and model the prompt posterior as an implicit distribution to capture diverse visual semantics. We derive a variational training objective under the semi-implicit variational inference framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that pFedBayesPT consistently outperforms existing pFL methods under both feature and label heterogeneity settings.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |

Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

The existing approaches suffer from limited real-world applicability due to their reliance on full prompt annotations, fixed number of frames and instances, and the lack of actor consistency. To bridge the gap, we proposed PromptGAR, which is the first GAR model to provide input flexibility across prompts, frames, and instances without the need for retraining. We leverage diverse visual prompts, like bounding boxes, skeletal keypoints, and instance identities, by unifying them as point prompts. A recognition decoder then cross-updates class and prompt tokens for enhanced performance. To ensure actor consistency for extended activity durations, we also introduce a relative instance attention mechanism that directly encodes instance identities. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PromptGAR achieves competitive performances both on full prompts and partial prompt inputs, establishing its effectiveness on input flexibility and generalization ability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[VPN: Visual Prompt Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01766v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation.

| **[PromptRR: Diffusion Models as Prompt Generators for Single Image Reflection Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02374v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing single image reflection removal (SIRR) methods using deep learning tend to miss key low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) differences in images, affecting their effectiveness in removing reflections. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel prompt-guided reflection removal (PromptRR) framework that uses frequency information as new visual prompts for better reflection performance. Specifically, the proposed framework decouples the reflection removal process into the prompt generation and subsequent prompt-guided restoration. For the prompt generation, we first propose a prompt pre-training strategy to train a frequency prompt encoder that encodes the ground-truth image into LF and HF prompts. Then, we adopt diffusion models (DMs) as prompt generators to generate the LF and HF prompts estimated by the pre-trained frequency prompt encoder. For the prompt-guided restoration, we integrate specially generated prompts into the PromptFormer network, employing a novel Transformer-based prompt block to effectively steer the model toward enhanced reflection removal. The results on commonly used benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Constrained Prompt Enhancement for Improving Zero-Shot Generalization of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17417v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components: Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model, effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts. Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control and overall consistency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Label Anything, a novel transformer-based architecture designed for multi-prompt, multi-way few-shot semantic segmentation. Our approach leverages diverse visual prompts -- points, bounding boxes, and masks -- to create a highly flexible and generalizable framework that significantly reduces annotation burden while maintaining high accuracy. Label Anything makes three key contributions: ($\textit{i}$) we introduce a new task formulation that relaxes conventional few-shot segmentation constraints by supporting various types of prompts, multi-class classification, and enabling multiple prompts within a single image; ($\textit{ii}$) we propose a novel architecture based on transformers and attention mechanisms; and ($\textit{iii}$) we design a versatile training procedure allowing our model to operate seamlessly across different $N$-way $K$-shot and prompt-type configurations with a single trained model. Our extensive experimental evaluation on the widely used COCO-$20^i$ benchmark demonstrates that Label Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing multi-way few-shot segmentation methods, while significantly outperforming leading single-class models when evaluated in multi-class settings.

However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically, DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) Dictionary Construction - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) Dictionary Lookup - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) Query Discrimination Regularization - to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, Project: https://github.com/xiaozhen228/DictAS</p></details> |

In this paper, we analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based IL in IOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV Workshops 2025</p></details> |

Action-driven video generation faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions (HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of cross-domain dynamics.

In contrast, most existing robotic systems rely on carefully positioned fixed or multi-camera setups with complete scene visibility, which limits adaptability and incurs high hardware costs. We present \textbf{RoboRetriever}, a novel framework for real-world object retrieval that operates using only a \textbf{single} wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and free-form natural language instructions. RoboRetriever grounds visual observations to build and update a \textbf{dynamic hierarchical scene graph} that encodes object semantics, geometry, and inter-object relations over time. The supervisor module reasons over this memory and task instruction to infer the target object and coordinate an integrated action module combining \textbf{active perception}, \textbf{interactive perception}, and \textbf{manipulation}. To enable task-aware scene-grounded active perception, we introduce a novel visual prompting scheme that leverages large reasoning vision-language models to determine 6-DoF camera poses aligned with the semantic task goal and geometry scene context. We evaluate RoboRetriever on diverse real-world object retrieval tasks, including scenarios with human intervention, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness in cluttered scenes with only one RGB-D camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention to the Burstiness in Visual Prompt Tuning!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22908v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; v2: camera ready</p></details> |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended journal version of arXiv:2506.03662</p></details> |

The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Stepwise Decomposition and Dual-stream Focus: A Novel Approach for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06818v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

| **[Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14976v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations, we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities, enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11 benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at: https://github.com/zzeoZheng/HiCroPL.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Simple yet Powerful Instance-Aware Prompting Framework for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06904v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings. While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2) \textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3) Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art training-free COS methods.</p></details> | under review |

Although recent research has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

| **[Visual Prompting for Robotic Manipulation with Annotation-Guided Pick-and-Place Using ACT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08748v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm, enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and adaptability in retail environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning for Continual Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08612v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames. However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the alignment with instructions and realism in two ways. First, SPIE captures fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. Second, it achieves precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIE can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where targeted image edits enhance the visual realism of simulated environments, which improves their utility as proxy for real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language Models Fail to Identify Relative Positions in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00549v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite. Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o, Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset, designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative positions in medical images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP) model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints. Our work establishes a new paradigm for scalable multimodal detection and data generation in open-world scenarios.

| **[ANPrompt: Anti-noise Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04677v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead. However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally, ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel categories.</p></details> |  |

Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

However, data distribution disparities due to heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder, named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples, encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322% of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT) method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality, efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal recognition models in the DAS domain.</p></details> |  |

Current AV-SSL methodologies typically require spatially-paired audio-visual data and cannot selectively localize specific target sources. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross-Instance Audio-Visual Localization (CI-AVL), a novel task that localizes target sound sources using visual prompts from different instances of the same semantic class. CI-AVL enables selective localization without spatially paired data. To solve this task, we propose AV-SSAN, a semantic-spatial alignment framework centered on a Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment Network (MB-SSA Net). MB-SSA Net decomposes the audio spectrogram into multiple frequency bands, aligns each band with semantic visual prompts, and refines spatial cues to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA). To facilitate this research, we construct VGGSound-SSL, a large-scale dataset comprising 13,981 spatial audio clips across 296 categories, each paired with visual prompts. AV-SSAN achieves a mean absolute error of 16.59 and an accuracy of 71.29%, significantly outperforming existing AV-SSL methods. Code and data will be public.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information. Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting.

However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

This limitation is critical in domains with dense homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO (Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning. Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9 percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted preference learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Disentangled Modeling of Trigger-Object Pairings for Backdoor Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01932v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training pipelines.</p></details> |  |

The latter, also known as region-based correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images. In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models (e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X, such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts, inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and, as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-based Discovery of Intrinsic Coordinates and Governing Equations from High-Dimensional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11940v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering governing equations from scientific data is crucial for understanding the evolution of systems, and is typically framed as a search problem within a candidate equation space. However, the high-dimensional nature of dynamical systems leads to an exponentially expanding equation space, making the search process extremely challenging. The visual perception and pre-trained scientific knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLM) hold promise for providing effective navigation in high-dimensional equation spaces. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot method based on MLLM for automatically discovering physical coordinates and governing equations from high-dimensional data. Specifically, we design a series of enhanced visual prompts for MLLM to enhance its spatial perception. In addition, MLLM's domain knowledge is employed to navigate the search process within the equation space. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two representative types of systems demonstrate that the proposed method effectively discovers the physical coordinates and equations from both simulated and real experimental data, with long-term extrapolation accuracy improved by approximately 26.96% compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While visual prompt engineering has advanced in text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement. Extensive testing and user studies demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE VIS VAST 2025 ACM 2012 CCS - Human-centered computing, Visualization, Visualization design and evaluation methods</p></details> |

This paper introduces GSON, a novel group-based social navigation framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance robots' social perception capabilities. Our approach uses visual prompting to enable zero-shot extraction of social relationships among pedestrians and integrates these results with robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipelines to overcome the inherent inference speed limitations of LMMs. The planning system incorporates a mid-level planner that sits between global path planning and local motion planning, effectively preserving both global context and reactive responsiveness while avoiding disruption of the predicted social group. We validate GSON through extensive real-world mobile robot navigation experiments involving complex social scenarios such as queuing, conversations, and photo sessions. Comparative results show that our system significantly outperforms existing navigation approaches in minimizing social perturbations while maintaining comparable performance on traditional navigation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA).

The system operates in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures image privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To improve transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which extracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with global information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the open-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms state-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA datasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively. Additionally, our method surpasses the non-grid version by 24 points on localization-based questions we created using NExT-QA.

| **[Object-centric Video Question Answering with Visual Grounding and Referring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19599v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses, restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video and image understanding.

| **[Affordance-Guided Reinforcement Learning via Visual Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10341v6)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to learn a wide range of skills solely from a reward signal. However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as human demonstrations of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics that can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we present Keypoint-based Affordance Guidance for Improvements (KAGI), a method leveraging rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous RL. State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated impressive zero-shot reasoning about affordances through keypoints, and we use these to define dense rewards that guide autonomous robotic learning. On diverse real-world manipulation tasks specified by natural language descriptions, KAGI improves the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enables successful task completion in 30K online fine-tuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of KAGI to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pre-training, reaching similar performance in 45K online fine-tuning steps.

| **[Visual Adaptive Prompting for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20292v6)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives--such as attributes and objects--that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose a Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalization Toolkit: Training Free Personalization of Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02452v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) involves customizing models to recognize specific users and object instances, and to generate contextually tailored responses. Existing approaches typically rely on time-consuming test-time training for each user or object, making them impractical for real-world deployment, a limitation reflected in current personalization benchmarks, which are focused on object-centric, single-concept evaluations. In this paper, we present a novel training-free approach to LVLM personalization and introduce a comprehensive real-world benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate various aspects of the personalization task. Our method leverages pre-trained vision foundation models to extract distinctive features, applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to identify instances within visual inputs, and employs visual prompting strategies to guide model outputs. Our model-agnostic vision toolkit enables efficient and flexible multi-concept personalization across both images and videos, without any additional training. We achieve state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing training-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing 3D multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information.

However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in enhancing video comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Scalable Unified Modeling for General Low-Level Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14801v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible integration with various architectures and effective utilization of task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity. We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization, few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general low-level vision modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[CVPT: Cross Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14961v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged to mitigate the computational demands of large-scale models. Within computer vision, adapter-based PEFT methods are often favored over prompt-based approaches like Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) due to the latter's performance and efficiency limitations. Our analysis reveals that VPT's shortcomings stem from its prompt deployment strategy, which can distort the model's inherent self-attention mechanism. To address this, we propose Cross Visual Prompt Tuning (CVPT). CVPT introduces a cross-attention module to directly model interactions between prompts and image tokens. This design decouples the prompts from the input sequence, preserving the original self-attention integrity while enabling efficient feature integration. Furthermore, we employ a weight-sharing mechanism for cross-attention initialization, which enhances representative capability without a large parameter overhead. Extensive experiments across 25 datasets show that CVPT significantly outperforms VPT. For instance, on the VTAB-1K benchmark, CVPT achieves over 4% higher average accuracy, rivaling leading adapter-based methods in both performance and efficiency. Our work confirms that prompt-based methods can achieve exceptional results in visual fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/Lingyun0419/CVPT</p></details> |  |
| **[CycleSAM: Few-Shot Surgical Scene Segmentation with Cycle- and Scene-Consistent Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06795v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical image segmentation is highly challenging, primarily due to scarcity of annotated data. Generalist prompted segmentation models like the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) can help tackle this task, but because they require image-specific visual prompts for effective performance, their use is limited to improving data annotation efficiency. Recent approaches extend SAM to automatic segmentation by using a few labeled reference images to predict point prompts; however, they rely on feature matching pipelines that lack robustness to out-of-domain data like surgical images. To tackle this problem, we introduce CycleSAM, an improved visual prompt learning approach that employs a data-efficient training phase and enforces a series of soft constraints to produce high-quality feature similarity maps. CycleSAM label-efficiently addresses domain gap by leveraging surgery-specific self-supervised feature extractors, then adapts the resulting features through a short parameter-efficient training stage, enabling it to produce informative similarity maps. CycleSAM further filters the similarity maps with a series of consistency constraints before robustly sampling diverse point prompts for each object instance. In our experiments on four diverse surgical datasets, we find that CycleSAM outperforms existing few-shot SAM approaches by a factor of 2-4x in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, while also achieving strong performance gains over traditional linear probing, parameter-efficient adaptation, and pseudo-labeling methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained, identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process. This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips. Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation, showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video restoration.</p></details> | Accepted by MM 2025 |
| **[Benchmarking Unified Face Attack Detection via Hierarchical Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13327v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PAD and FFD are proposed to protect face data from physical media-based Presentation Attacks and digital editing-based DeepFakes, respectively. However, isolated training of these two models significantly increases vulnerability towards unknown attacks, burdening deployment environments. The lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to simultaneously handle attacks in these two categories is mainly attributed to two factors: (1) A benchmark that is sufficient for models to explore is lacking. Existing UAD datasets only contain limited attack types and samples, leading to the model's confined ability to address abundant advanced threats. In light of these, through an explainable hierarchical way, we propose the most extensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques available to date, namely UniAttackDataPlus. Our UniAttackData+ encompasses 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of corresponding falsified samples, in a total of 697,347 videos. (2) The absence of a trustworthy classification criterion. Current methods endeavor to explore an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic space, which fails to exist when encountering diverse attacks. Thus, we present a novel Visual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework that adaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic spaces. Specifically, we construct a VP-Tree to explore various classification rules hierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select the most suitable prompts guiding the encoder to extract discriminative features at different levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, to help the model understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a DPI module to project the visual prompts to the text encoder to help obtain a more accurate semantics.</p></details> |  |

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context, and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals (facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics, others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |
| **[Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07796v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead, ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlative and Discriminative Label Grouping for Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09990v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling label correlations has always played a pivotal role in multi-label image classification (MLC), attracting significant attention from researchers. However, recent studies have overemphasized co-occurrence relationships among labels, which can lead to overfitting risk on this overemphasis, resulting in suboptimal models. To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing correlative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient method that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them respectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group contains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label relationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or discriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group contains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to multiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign them from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware representation, which is more conducive to classification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and outperforms SOTA methods on multiple pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Training-Free Reference-Based Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02798v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Prompt Disentanglement via Language Guidance and Representation Alignment for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02288v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM) and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Selective Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (SCING) that enhances cross-modal alignment and robustness against real-world perturbations. Our method introduces two key innovations: Firstly, we proposed Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP), a lightweight module that dynamically injects discriminative visual features into text prompts via a cross-modal gating mechanism. Moreover, the proposed Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) is a dual-path training strategy that enforces invariant feature alignment under random image perturbations by regularizing consistency between original and augmented cross-modal embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular benchmarks covering Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, Occluded-Duke, Occluded-REID, and P-DukeMTMC, which demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed method. Notably, our framework eliminates heavy adapters while maintaining efficient inference, achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |

We propose a simple yet effective Region Conditioned Adaptation, a hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that equips the frozen CLIP with the ability to infer explanations from local visual cues. We encode "local hints" and "global contexts" into visual prompts of the CLIP model separately at fine and coarse-grained levels. Adapters are used for fine-tuning CLIP models for downstream tasks and we design a new attention adapter, that directly steers the focus of the attention map with trainable query and key projections of a frozen CLIP model. Finally, we train our new model with a modified contrastive loss to regress the visual feature simultaneously toward features of literal description and plausible explanations. The loss enables CLIP to maintain both perception and reasoning abilities. Experiments on the Sherlock visual abductive reasoning benchmark show that the RCA significantly outstands previous SOTAs, ranking the 1st on the leaderboards (e.g., Human Acc: RCA 31.74 $\textit{vs}$ CPT-CLIP 29.58, higher =better). We also validate the RCA is generalizable to local perception benchmarks like RefCOCO.

Prompt-based methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models, providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

However, existing document analysis solutions, such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient, multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at https://github.com/pd162/RoI-Matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDAR2025</p></details> |
| **[Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation via Discrepancy-Weighted Experience Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00042v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset, involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative object detection frameworks.</p></details> | ICANN 2025 |
| **[Visual Prompt Engineering for Vision Language Models in Radiology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15802v3)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image classification plays a crucial role in clinical decision-making, yet most models are constrained to a fixed set of predefined classes, limiting their adaptability to new conditions. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers, such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles, directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretable predictions.To support further research, we use public datasets and provide our codebase and preprocessing pipeline under https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/VPE-in-Radiology, serving as a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 Workshop on Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models & Medical Imaging with Deep Learning 2025</p></details> |

For precise control of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules. Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously. Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively.

While recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients' identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.</p></details> | IPMI 2025 |

Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image. However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks. For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU, highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Zero-Shot Temporal Interaction Localization for Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03662v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes. AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria: comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level, point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.</p></details> |  |

While tools like LabelImg can handle the labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic, real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

The mobile design usually consists of design mock-ups that specify (1) the expected screen appearances (e.g., widget layouts, colors, and shapes) and (2) the expected screen behaviors, regarding how one screen can transition into another (e.g., labeled widgets with textual description). Given a design mock-up and the implementation of its application, GUIPilot reports both their screen inconsistencies as well as process inconsistencies. On the one hand, GUIPilot detects the screen inconsistencies by abstracting every screen into a widget container where each widget is represented by its position, width, height, and type. By defining the partial order of widgets and the costs of replacing, inserting, and deleting widgets in a screen, we convert the screen-matching problem into an optimizable widget alignment problem. On the other hand, we translate the specified GUI transition into stepwise actions on the mobile screen (e.g., click, long-press, input text on some widgets). To this end, we propose a visual prompt for the vision-language model to infer widget-specific actions on the screen. By this means, we can validate the presence or absence of expected transitions in the implementation. Our extensive experiments on 80 mobile applications and 160 design mock-ups show that (1) GUIPilot can achieve 94.5% precision and 99.6% recall in detecting screen inconsistencies, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach, such as GVT, by 66.2% and 56.6% respectively, and (2) GUIPilot reports zero errors in detecting process inconsistencies. Furthermore, our industrial case study on applying GUIPilot on a trading mobile application shows that GUIPilot has detected nine application bugs, and all the bugs were confirmed by the original application experts.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score), optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/RuoyuChen10/EAGLE.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods.

MLLMs have shown promising capability in aligning visual and textual modalities, allowing them to process image-text pairs with clear and explicit meanings. However, resolving the inherent ambiguities present in real-world language and visual contexts remains a challenge. Existing multimodal benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios. MUCAR includes first a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and second a dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the boundaries of multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22415v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.</p></details> |  |

We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://w2genai-lab.github.io/LucidFlux</p></details> |

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://amap-ml.github.io/NarrLV-Website/</p></details> |

We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a 311-task benchmark that enforces multimodal understanding by requiring extraction and propagation of fine-grained visual cues through iterative image-text retrieval and cross-validation under retrieval noise. Our curation procedure seeds questions whose answers require extrapolating from spatial cues and temporal traces to out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. Beyond the dataset, we provide a model-agnostic agent framework with standard browsing tools and a set-of-mark (SoM) module, which lets the agent place marks, crop subregions, and launch targeted image/text searches. SoM enables provenance-aware zoom-and-retrieve and improves robustness in multi-step reasoning. We evaluated closed- and open-source MLLMs in this framework. The strongest system achieves an end-to-end accuracy of 36.0%, and integrating SoM produces consistent gains in multiple settings, with improvements up to +3.9 points. From failure analysis, we observe recurring errors in locating relevant webpages and distinguishing between visually similar events. These results underscore the challenges of real-world multimodal search and establish MMSearch-Plus as a rigorous benchmark for advancing agentic MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mmsearch-plus.github.io</p></details> |

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present \textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels. Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\% accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we delve into the relationship between model scaling and performance, systematically exploring the performance trends in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and test-time configurations. Through extensive evaluations on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing, InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong potential for test-time scaling. We hope this model contributes to the open-source community by setting new standards for developing and applying multimodal AI systems.

General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses. Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in healthcare.

| **[UrbanFeel: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Temporal and Perceptual Understanding of City Scenes through Human Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22228v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development. Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as beautiful and safety.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Reasoning to Edit: Hypothetical Instruction-Based Image Editing with Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01908v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our dataset and code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynamicControl: Adaptive Condition Selection for Improved Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03255v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAT-KG: Knowledge-Intensive Multimodal Knowledge Graph Dataset for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21556v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations restrict applicability to multimodal tasks, particularly as recent MLLMs adopt richer modalities like video and audio. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information, where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities. Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vatkg.github.io/</p></details> |

In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability, failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i) the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions: procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the I-HFM Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional discriminative paradigms that rely on predefined emotion taxonomies, DMER aims to describe human emotional state using free-form natural language, enabling finer-grained and more interpretable emotion representations. However, this free-form prediction paradigm introduces new challenges regarding its evaluation. Previous works depend on ground-truth descriptions, but emotions are inherently tied to diverse human behaviors, and generating a comprehensive and accurate description is inherently demanding. Other researchers reformulate this problem into a more tractable human preference learning task, but pairwise preference annotation involves substantial manual effort. This leads to a question: can we leverage multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to achieve more cost-efficient preference annotation? To answer this, we propose EmoPrefer, a pioneering work exploring the potential of LLMs in decoding human emotion preferences. Specifically, we construct the first emotion preference dataset, EmoPrefer-Data, featuring high-quality preference annotations from experts. Additionally, we introduce EmoPrefer-Bench, which evaluates the performance of various MLLMs and prompting techniques in preference prediction, while also revealing new strategies to enhance their performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring the capabilities of LLMs in understanding human emotion preferences. Our work advances the field of DMER and lays the foundation for more intelligent human-computer interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03262v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly integrate multiple vision encoders to improve performance on various benchmarks, assuming that diverse pretraining objectives yield complementary visual signals. However, we show this assumption often fails in practice. Through systematic encoder masking across representative multi encoder MLLMs, we find that performance typically degrades gracefully and sometimes even improves when selected encoders are masked, revealing pervasive encoder redundancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce two principled metrics: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), which measures an encoders marginal contribution in the presence of others, and the Information Gap (IG), which captures heterogeneity in encoder utility within a model. Using these tools, we observe (i) strong specialization on tasks like OCR and Chart, where a single encoder can dominate with a CUR greater than 90%, (ii) high redundancy on general VQA and knowledge-based tasks, where encoders are largely interchangeable, (iii) instances of detrimental encoders with negative CUR. Notably, masking specific encoders can yield up to 16% higher accuracy on a specific task category and 3.6% overall performance boost compared to the full model.Furthermore, single and dual encoder variants recover over 90% of baseline on most non OCR tasks. Our analysis challenges the more encoders are better heuristic in MLLMs and provides actionable diagnostics for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exposing Hallucinations To Suppress Them: VLMs Representation Editing With Generative Anchors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21997v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations, persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation. Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g., achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR. Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B, Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions, our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Customizing Visual Emotion Evaluation for MLLMs: An Open-vocabulary, Multifaceted, and Scalable Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21950v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps, underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/MVEI.</p></details> |  |

However, current research lacks both evaluation benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. Inspired by mathematics, where simple operations yield infinite verifiable problems, we introduce a novel approach that treats core music theory rules, such as those governing beats and intervals, as programmatic functions to systematically synthesize a vast and diverse corpus of sheet music reasoning problems. This approach allows us to introduce a data synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on SSMR-Bench highlight the key role reasoning plays in interpreting sheet music, while also pointing out the ongoing challenges in understanding sheet music in a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, all models show significant improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Additionally, they also demonstrate considerable advancements on previously established human-crafted benchmarks, such as MusicTheoryBench and the music subset of MMMU. Finally, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also facilitate music composition.</p></details> | 34 pages |

While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.</p></details> | 20 pages (Preprint.) |

The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs, which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of multimodal aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely, Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order, improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSS-ChatV: Reinforcement Learning with Process Reasoning Reward for Video Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21113v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct, undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation. MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2, confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.</p></details> |  |

However, we observe that directly tuning the Instruct (i.e., instruction-tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even performance degeneration. Notably, paired Base models, the foundation for these Instruct variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on average for Llama 3.1 8B). The Base model tends to be a good learner yet a weak backbone without post-training. Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to tune the Instruct models by leveraging the corresponding Base models. The key insight is to fine-tune the Base model, and then \textit{directly} graft the learned weight updates to the Instruct model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with direct preference optimization~(DPO).

However, their application in the medical domain is constrained by two key challenges: (1) multimodal medical datasets are scarce and often contain sparse information, limiting reasoning depth; and (2) Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), though effective in general domains, cannot reliably improve model performance in the medical domain. To overcome these challenges, during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we incorporate high-quality textual reasoning data and general multimodal data alongside multimodal medical data to efficiently enhance foundational medical capabilities and restore the base model's reasoning ability. Moreover, considering that there are some multimodal medical datasets with sparse information, we further synthesize reflective-pattern-injected chain-of-thought (CoT) in addition to general CoT samples, equipping the model with initial reflective reasoning capabilities that provide a structured foundation for subsequent RLVR training. Finally, we introduce our InfiMed-Series models, InfiMed-SFT-3B and InfiMed-RL-3B, both of which deliver state-of-the-art performance across seven multimodal medical benchmarks. Notably, InfiMed-RL-3B achieves an average accuracy of 59.2%, outperforming even larger models like InternVL3-8B, which achieves 57.3%. Specifically, during the SFT phase, we utilized 188K samples, while the RLVR phase incorporated 36K samples, demonstrating the efficacy of both training strategies in achieving superior performance. We also conducted a series of extensive experiments, which provide valuable insights that contribute to advancing the performance of MLLMs in medical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking MLLM-based Web Understanding: Reasoning, Robustness and Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21782v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions. To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination Through Theory-Consistent Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11712v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks interpretability: they only determine whether two images correspond, without explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy. Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/GLEAM.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Sparsity Forcing: Reinforcing Token Sparsity of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18579v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead with minimal accuracy loss by selectively processing salient tokens. Despite their effectiveness, most methods merely exploit a model's inherent sparsity and thus plateau at moderate budgets (about 50\% token reduction), with little headroom to push budget lower without hurting accuracy. Other approaches attempt to enforce sparsity through trainable sparse attention or sharpness-inducing regularizers, but these either fix rigid patterns that ignore input and layer dynamics, or optimize proxy objectives without direct control over token budgets. In this paper, we explicitly reinforce token sparsity in well-posed multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through a simple RL-based post-training framework named \textit{Sparsity Forcing}. Our method explores the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by running multiple rollouts with different token budgets, where both efficiency (token reduction ratio) and performance (answer correctness) are formulated as joint rewards. By contrasting rollouts within each group, the more efficient and correct answer is rewarded while less efficient or incorrect ones are penalized, thereby turning token saving into an end-to-end, inference-consistent optimization objective. Across thirteen image and video benchmarks, Sparsity Forcing raises token reduction ratio on Qwen2-VL/Qwen2.5-VL from 20\% to 75\% with minimal accuracy decline, significantly reducing long-context inference memory by up to 3$\times$ while speeding up decoding by up to 3.3$\times$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-Enhanced Domain-Adaptive Pretraining of Multimodal Large Language Models for Short Video Content Moderation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21486v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3) \textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks, VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation of video understanding tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, we found that MLLMs cannot process effectively from fine-grained medical image data in the traditional Visual Question Answering (VQA) pipeline, as they do not exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge fully, results in MLLMs usually performing poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition. Fortunately, this limitation does not indicate that MLLMs are fundamentally incapable of addressing fine-grained recognition tasks. From a feature representation perspective, MLLMs demonstrate considerable potential for tackling such challenging problems. Thus, to address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition via utilizing the existing MLLM features. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition, achieving the comparable performance to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

In this work, we select ASCII art as a representative artifact. It depicts concepts through careful arrangement of characters, which can be formulated in both text and image modalities. We frame the problem as a recognition task, and construct a novel benchmark, ASCIIEval. It covers over 3K samples with an elaborate categorization tree, along with a training set for further enhancement. Encompassing a comprehensive analysis of tens of models through different input modalities, our benchmark demonstrate its multi-faceted diagnostic power. Given textual input, language models shows their visual perception ability on ASCII art concepts. Proprietary models achieve over 70% accuracy on certain categories, with GPT-5 topping the rank. For image inputs, we reveal that open-source MLLMs suffer from a trade-off between fine-grained text recognition and collective visual perception. They exhibit limited generalization ability to this special kind of arts, leading to the dramatic gap of over 20.01% accuracy compared with their proprietary counterparts. Another critical finding is that model performance is sensitive to the length of the ASCII art, with this sensitivity varying across input modalities. Unfortunately, none of the models could successfully benefit from the simultaneous provision of both modalities, highlighting the need for more flexible modality-fusion approaches. Besides, we also introduce approaches for further enhancement and discuss future directions. Resources are available at https://github.com/JiaQiSJTU/VisionInText.</p></details> |  |

However, their efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25 individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable OCR in dynamic video scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%).

Existing methods mainly leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.</p></details> |  |

A foundational yet underexplored capability for this task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving. Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turning Internal Gap into Self-Improvement: Promoting the Generation-Understanding Unification in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16663v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although unified MLLMs aim to unify generation and understanding, they are considered to exhibit an internal gap, with understanding outperforming generation. Through large-scale evaluation across multiple MLLMs and tasks, we confirm the widespread non-unification of MLLMs, and demonstrate that it indeed stems from weak generation rather than misunderstanding. This finding motivates us to propose a simple yet effective internal gap-based self-improvement framework, which mitigates internal gaps by leveraging stronger understanding to guide weaker generation without relying on any external signals. We validate this strategy through comprehensive experiments: scoring generations with understanding to construct image data for post-training (e.g., SFT and DPO) significantly improves generation while promoting unification. Furthermore, we empirically discover a co-improvement effect of such self-improvement, a phenomenon well known in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Specifically, as generation improves, understanding becomes more effective at detecting false positives that were previously misclassified as prompt-aligned. To explain this effect, we extend learning dynamic theory to the MLLM setting, showing that the shared empirical neural tangent kernel between generation and understanding encourages aligned learning dynamics, thereby driving co-improvement. This interplay between generation and understanding further motivates a curriculum learning approach for stronger self-improvement: progressively enhanced understanding and generation revisit samples underutilized by pre-trained MLLMs, dynamically expanding post-training data and leading to improved performance and unification.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 16 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases. Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual, and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive, counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.</p></details> |  |

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in cooperative perception, prediction, and planning tasks.

| **[Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00798v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of these models in multimodal understanding and reasoning. However, the performance of MLLMs for knowledge-intensive visual questions, which require external knowledge beyond the visual content of an image, still remains limited. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution to provide models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and incorporates knowledge synthesis to refine its understanding. At each iteration, the model formulates a reasoning-guided multi-query to explore multiple facets of knowledge. Subsequently, these queries drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, retrieving diverse knowledge. This retrieved knowledge is then synthesized to enrich the reasoning record, progressively deepening the model's understanding. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |

We address VLN in continuous environments, a particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions. We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints, which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of 41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks are limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks, and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition, lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios. We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity. EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 22 figures; Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Dataset and Benchmark Track</p></details> |

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

| **[Adaptive Guidance Semantically Enhanced via Multimodal LLM for Edge-Cloud Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19875v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeEraser: Enhancing Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models through Multimodal Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12520v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThinkFake: Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for AI-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19841v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs. We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great potential for advancing scene perception in the medical domain, facilitating surgeons to understand surgical scenes and procedures. However, these methods are primarily oriented towards image-based analysis or global video understanding, overlooking the fine-grained video reasoning that is crucial for analyzing specific processes and capturing detailed task execution within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM, the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K that is a large-scale dataset with over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures. Building on this resource, SurgVidLM incorporates a two-stage StageFocus mechanism: the first stage extracts global procedural context, while the second stage performs high-frequency local analysis guided by temporal cues. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively integrate low- and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the preservation of critical task-specific details. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs of comparable parameter scale in both full and fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in capturing the context of complex robot-assisted surgeries. Our code and dataset will be publicly accessible soon.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), leveraging the power of LLMs, enable generating textual summaries directly from speech without intermediate transcriptions, while supporting controllable styles and zero-shot generalization. However, open-source MLLMs continue to lag behind the state-of-the-art text-based LLMs, limiting their practical deployment for speech summarization. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage reinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization capabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Visual Text Grounding of Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04974v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This paper evaluates the impact of structural pruning and activation-aware quantization on a fine-tuned LLAVA model for medical applications. We propose a novel layer selection method for pruning, analyze different quantization techniques, and assess the performance trade-offs in a prune-SFT-quantize pipeline. Our proposed method enables MLLMs with 7B parameters to run within 4 GB of VRAM, reducing memory usage by 70% while achieving 4% higher model performance compared to traditional pruning and quantization techniques in the same compression ratio.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks, which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues, often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction, integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like analysis.

Specifically, we aim to capture frequent co-occurring changes ("trends") across a city over a certain period. Unlike previous visual analyses, our analysis answers open-ended queries (e.g., "what are the frequent types of changes in the city?") without any predetermined target subjects or training labels. These properties cast prior learning-based or unsupervised visual analysis tools unsuitable. We identify MLLMs as a novel tool for their open-ended semantic understanding capabilities. Yet, our datasets are four orders of magnitude too large for an MLLM to ingest as context. So we introduce a bottom-up procedure that decomposes the massive visual analysis problem into more tractable sub-problems. We carefully design MLLM-based solutions to each sub-problem. During experiments and ablation studies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is able to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g., "addition of outdoor dining,", "overpass was painted blue," etc.).

Existing methods often fail to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity (missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity, oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>A lig...</summary><p>A lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context</p></details> |

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.</p></details> |  |

Model merging seeks to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code and math tasks. Recently, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that extend LLMs through large-scale multimodal training have gained traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, $\textbf{(i)}$ we introduce a model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, studying both LoRA and full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language models), moving toward the Omni-language model. $\textbf{(ii)}$ We implement 10 model merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average performance gain of 2.48%. $\textbf{(iii)}$ We find that model merging offers a promising way for building improved MLLMs without requiring training data. Our results also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms individual modalities.</p></details> |  |

This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery, segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2) semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free, the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/openset_remotesensing_tagging-2B5F/README.md</p></details> |

Since large language models (LLM) exhibit impressive potential in content understanding and reasoning, current methods explore to leverage LLM to comprehend the complicated relationships among user, query and product to improve the search performance of PPS. Despite the progress, LLM-based PPS solutions merely take textual contents into consideration, neglecting multimodal contents which play a critical role for product search. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework, HMPPS, for \textbf{H}arnessing \textbf{M}ultimodal large language models (MLLM) to deal with \textbf{P}ersonalized \textbf{P}roduct \textbf{S}earch based on multimodal contents. Nevertheless, the redundancy and noise in PPS input stand for a great challenge to apply MLLM for PPS, which not only misleads MLLM to generate inaccurate search results but also increases the computation expense of MLLM. To deal with this problem, we additionally design two query-aware refinement modules for HMPPS: 1) a perspective-guided summarization module that generates refined product descriptions around core perspectives relevant to search query, reducing noise and redundancy within textual contents; and 2) a two-stage training paradigm that introduces search query for user history filtering based on multimodal representations, capturing precise user preferences and decreasing the inference cost. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of HMPPS. Furthermore, HMPPS is deployed on an online search system with billion-level daily active users and achieves an evident gain in A/B testing.</p></details> |  |

This task poses significant challenges in cross-modal reasoning and fine-grained object localization. In this paper, we propose a simple framework, SimToken, that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The MLLM is guided to generate a special semantic token representing the referred object. This compact token, enriched with contextual information from all modalities, acts as a prompt to guide SAM to segment objectsacross video frames. To further improve semantic learning, we introduce a novel target-consistent semantic alignment loss that aligns token embeddings from different expressions but referring to the same object. Experiments on the Ref-AVS benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/DianJin-HFUT/SimToken</p></details> |

To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference. 23 pages (8+ for main); 25 figures; 1 table</p></details> |

Photographer and curator, Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection, localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark, PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates clear advantages over existing models.</p></details> |  |

However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor, sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of nine leading MLLMs, including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro, and GPT-4o, on EmoBench-Reddit.</p></details> | <details><summary>I nee...</summary><p>I need to modify the content of the article</p></details> |

While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets, a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object detection models tailored to institutional needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Achieving this requires systematic improvements in model architecture, data construction, and training strategies, particularly to address challenges such as performance degradation with increasing image counts and high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer blocks, introduce data construction methods that capture both temporal and spatial dependencies, and employ a progressive training strategy. Our released model, LongLLaVA (\textbf{Long}-Context \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{a}nd \textbf{V}ision \textbf{A}ssistant), demonstrates an effective balance between efficiency and performance. LongLLaVA achieves competitive results across various benchmarks while maintaining high throughput and low memory consumption.

| **[Serendipitous Recommendation with Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08283v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional recommendation systems succeed in identifying relevant content but often fail to provide users with surprising or novel items. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) possess the world knowledge and multimodal understanding needed for serendipity, but their integration into billion-item-scale platforms presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework where fine-tuned MLLMs provide high-level guidance to conventional recommendation models, steering them towards more serendipitous suggestions. This approach leverages MLLM strengths in understanding multimodal content and user interests while retaining the efficiency of traditional models for item-level recommendation. This mitigates the complexity of applying MLLMs directly to vast action spaces. We also demonstrate a chain-of-thought strategy enabling MLLMs to discover novel user interests by first understanding video content and then identifying relevant yet unexplored interest clusters. Through live experiments within a commercial short-form video platform serving billions of users, we show that our MLLM-powered approach significantly improves both recommendation serendipity and user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 Recsys EARL Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Diagnosis: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs for Pathology Localization in Chest Radiographs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18015v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01659v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 9 tasks from the stroke level to the rally level and includes 2943 human-verified questions. Evaluating 17 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2) insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process (manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks, ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for computer control.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MCoT methods rely on rationale-rich datasets and largely focus on inter-object reasoning, overlooking the intra-object understanding crucial for image classification. To address this gap, we propose WISE, a Weak-supervision-guided Step-by-step Explanation method that augments any image classification dataset with MCoTs by reformulating the concept-based representations from Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) into concise, interpretable reasoning chains under weak supervision. Experiments across ten datasets show that our generated MCoTs not only improve interpretability by 37% but also lead to gains in classification accuracy when used to fine-tune MLLMs. Our work bridges concept-based interpretability and generative MCoT reasoning, providing a generalizable framework for enhancing MLLMs in fine-grained visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

A central challenge of this task lies in accurately handling complex tables -- those with large sizes, deeply nested structures, and semantically rich or irregular cell content -- where existing methods often fail. We begin with a comprehensive analysis, identifying key challenges and highlighting the limitations of current evaluation protocols. To overcome these issues, we propose a reinforced multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework, where a pre-trained MLLM is fine-tuned on a large-scale table-to-LaTeX dataset. To further improve generation quality, we introduce a dual-reward reinforcement learning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike standard approaches that optimize purely over text outputs, our method incorporates both a structure-level reward on LaTeX code and a visual fidelity reward computed from rendered outputs, enabling direct optimization of the visual output quality. We adopt a hybrid evaluation protocol combining TEDS-Structure and CW-SSIM, and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on structurally complex tables, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Particularly in vision-intensive tasks like geometric reasoning, MLLMs hallucinate frequently, leading to inaccurate reasoning. We attribute this to the perceptual bottleneck in MLLMs, which caps the benefits of reasoning training. To quantify this, we design a Geo-Perception Question-Answering (GeoPQA) benchmark, targeting basic geometric concepts and spatial relationships. Experiments on GeoPQA reveal significant shortcomings of MLLMs in visual perception, which constrain RL reward signals for effective training. To address this bottleneck, we propose a two-stage RL training framework by first enhancing the visual perception of geometric structures, then fostering reasoning capabilities. Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, our two-stage training improves geometric reasoning by 9.7% and geometric problem solving by 9.1%, compared to the direct reasoning training approach. Our method also generalizes to other vision-intensive domains like figure understanding, highlighting the importance of perceptual grounding in effective MLLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2025 Findings</p></details> |

However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark, highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases.

Although embodied agents powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer rich perceptual and interactive capabilities, it remains largely unexplored whether they can solve composite tasks. In the current work, we designed a set of composite tasks inspired by common daily activities observed in early childhood development. Within a dynamic and simulated home environment, these tasks span three core domains: object understanding, spatial intelligence, and social activity. We evaluated 17 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs on these tasks. The results consistently showed poor performance across all three domains, indicating a substantial gap between current capabilities and general intelligence requirements. Together, our tasks offer a preliminary framework for evaluating the general capabilities of embodied agents, marking an early but significant step toward the development of embodied MLLMs and their real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Suitability of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to Visual Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05682v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is proved to be greatly valuable for enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs. Researchers have been starting to apply RFT to MLLMs, hoping it will also enhance the capabilities of visual understanding. However, these works are at a very early stage and have not examined how suitable RFT actually is for visual tasks. In this work, we endeavor to understand the suitabilities and limitations of RFT for visual tasks, through experimental analysis and observations. We start by quantitative comparisons on various tasks, which shows RFT is generally better than SFT on visual tasks. %especially when the number of training samples are limited. To check whether such advantages are brought up by the reasoning process, we design a new reward that encourages the model to ``think'' more, whose results show more thinking can be beneficial for complicated tasks but harmful for simple tasks. We hope this study can provide more insight for the rapid advancements on this topic.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-Driven Semantic Identifier Generation for Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17359v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative cross-modal retrieval, which treats retrieval as a generation task, has emerged as a promising direction with the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In this setting, the model responds to a text query by generating an identifier corresponding to the target image. However, existing methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels, or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs. These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MoMentS (Multimodal Mental States), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the ToM capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) through realistic, narrative-rich scenarios presented in short films. MoMentS includes over 2,300 multiple-choice questions spanning seven distinct ToM categories. The benchmark features long video context windows and realistic social interactions that provide deeper insight into characters' mental states. We evaluate several MLLMs and find that although vision generally improves performance, models still struggle to integrate it effectively. For audio, models that process dialogues as audio do not consistently outperform transcript-based inputs. Our findings highlight the need to improve multimodal integration and point to open challenges that must be addressed to advance AI's social understanding.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model. Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.</p></details> | EMNLP25 |

We also release VaseVQA, a comprehensive benchmark of 31,773 images designed to probe deep understanding. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on style classification and historical attribution with marked gains in compositional robustness over SFT-only baselines, validating diagnosis-guided, taxonomy-conditioned reward engineering and providing a reusable resource for future research.

Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) deliver strong reasoning capabilities but incur prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight edge models often fail on complex cases.

The framework is composed of three synergistic components: (1) Efficient MLLM Fine-Tuning for Complex Defect Inspection, (2) Lightweight Multiscale Scene-Complexity Estimation, and (3) Adaptive Edge-Cloud Scheduler. Together, these modules enable robust defect detection by tailoring multimodal reasoning to scene complexity and dynamically balancing computation between edge and cloud resources. Experimental results on MVTec AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that SAEC attains 85.11% and 82.72% accuracy, surpassing Qwen by 22.1% and 20.8%, and LLaVA by 33.3% and 31.6%.

In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/AMOS-MM-Solution</p></details> |  |

While current multi-image benchmarks overlook interleaved textual contexts and neglect distinct relationships between individual images and their associated texts, enabling models to reason over multi-image interleaved data may significantly enhance their comprehension of complex scenes and better capture cross-modal correlations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark MIR, requiring joint reasoning over multiple images accompanied by interleaved textual contexts to accurately associate image regions with corresponding texts and logically connect information across images. To enhance MLLMs ability to comprehend multi-image interleaved data, we introduce reasoning steps for each instance within the benchmark and propose a stage-wise curriculum learning strategy. This strategy follows an "easy to hard" approach, progressively guiding models from simple to complex scenarios, thereby enhancing their ability to handle challenging tasks. Extensive experiments benchmarking multiple MLLMs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances models reasoning performance on MIR and other established benchmarks. We believe that MIR will encourage further research into multi-image interleaved reasoning, facilitating advancements in MLLMs capability to handle complex inter-modal tasks.Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Shelly-coder239/MIRBench.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose MoA-Off, an adaptive heterogeneous modality-aware offloading framework with edge-cloud collaboration for efficient MLLM inference. MoA-Off introduces a lightweight heterogeneous modality-aware module that estimates the complexity of heterogeneous inputs through multi-dimensional feature analysis. Then, an adaptive edge-cloud collaborative offloading strategy is proposed that dynamically schedules workloads between edge and cloud based on modality-aware complexity scores and real-time system states. The experimental results demonstrate that MoA-Off can achieve over 30% reduction in latency and 30%-65% decrease in resource overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their enhanced perceptual and reasoning abilities enable more comprehensive and interpretable audio quality assessment. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of audio editing evaluation and propose the first natural language-based automated evaluation framework built on MLLMs. Our approach introduces two fine-tuning tasks to boost multi-audio understanding, combined with Chain-of-Thought prompting, and lightweight instruction tuning, to enhance step-by-step reasoning. Experiment demonstrate that our framework delivers accurate, interpretable, and text-based editing evaluation, closely aligning with human judgments and objective metrics while substantially improving over baselines.

Building on Sa2VA, which couples a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the video segmentation model SAM2, we identify two key bottlenecks that limit segmentation performance: sparse frame sampling and reliance on a single [SEG] token for an entire video. We propose Segmentation Augmented and Selective Averaged Sa2VA SaSaSa2VA to address these issues. On the 7th LSVOS Challenge (RVOS track), SaSaSa2VA achieves a $J\&F$ of 67.45, ranking first and surpassing the runner-up by 2.80 points. This result and ablation studies demonstrate that efficient segmentation augmentation and test-time ensembling substantially enhance grounded MLLMs for RVOS.

| **[Catching the Details: Self-Distilled RoI Predictors for Fine-Grained MLLM Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16944v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate, requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly multi-pass operations.To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K) question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |
| **[MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%, representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67% and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Word ...</summary><p>Word count: 5157, Table count: 2, Figure count: 5</p></details> |
