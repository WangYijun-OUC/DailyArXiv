| **[ScoreAdv: Score-based Targeted Generation of Natural Adversarial Examples via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06078v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform, which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically, the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components. During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation. Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqCross: A Multi-Modal Frequency-Spatial Fusion Network for Robust Detection of Stable Diffusion 3.5 Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02995v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5, has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and (3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000 paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach. Code and pre-trained models are publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-free Optical Processors using In Situ Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05583v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance. Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 7 Figures |
| **[VERITAS: Verification and Explanation of Realness in Images for Transparency in AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05146v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at https://github.com/V-i-g-n-e-s-h-N/VERITAS .</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Driven Cytomorphology Image Synthesis for Medical Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05063v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy. However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to 78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations, enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and facilitating medical diagnosis and research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Parameterized Diffusion Optimization enabled Autoregressive Ordinal Regression for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04978v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care. Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However, there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step. Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Qinkaiyu/AOR-DR.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Clustering via Self-Supervised Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04283v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks, have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion (CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Fetal Plane Classification Accuracy with Data Augmentation Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15248v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound imaging is widely used in medical diagnosis, especially for fetal health assessment. However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[PosDiffAE: Position-aware Diffusion Auto-encoder For High-Resolution Brain Tissue Classification Incorporating Artifact Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02405v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation, which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the representations to regress positional information of the patches from high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (Early Access Available) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989734</p></details> |
| **[On the Trade-off between Flatness and Optimization in Distributed Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20006v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a theoretical framework to evaluate and compare the performance of stochastic gradient algorithms for distributed learning in relation to their behavior around local minima in nonconvex environments. Previous works have noticed that convergence toward flat local minima tend to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms. This work discovers three interesting results. First, it shows that decentralized learning strategies are able to escape faster away from local minima and favor convergence toward flatter minima relative to the centralized solution. Second, in decentralized methods, the consensus strategy has a worse excess-risk performance than diffusion, giving it a better chance of escaping from local minima and favoring flatter minima. Third, and importantly, the ultimate classification accuracy is not solely dependent on the flatness of the local minimum but also on how well a learning algorithm can approach that minimum. In other words, the classification accuracy is a function of both flatness and optimization performance. In this regard, since diffusion has a lower excess-risk than consensus, when both algorithms are trained starting from random initial points, diffusion enhances the classification accuracy. The paper examines the interplay between the two measures of flatness and optimization error closely. One important conclusion is that decentralized strategies deliver in general enhanced classification accuracy because they strike a more favorable balance between flatness and optimization performance compared to the centralized solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embedding-Space Diffusion for Zero-Shot Environmental Sound Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03771v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot learning enables models to generalise to unseen classes by leveraging semantic information, bridging the gap between training and testing sets with non-overlapping classes. While much research has focused on zero-shot learning in computer vision, the application of these methods to environmental audio remains underexplored, with poor performance in existing studies. Generative methods, which have demonstrated success in computer vision, are notably absent from zero-shot environmental sound classification studies. To address this gap, this work investigates generative methods for zero-shot learning in environmental audio. Two successful generative models from computer vision are adapted: a cross-aligned and distribution-aligned variational autoencoder (CADA-VAE) and a leveraging invariant side generative adversarial network (LisGAN). Additionally, we introduced a novel diffusion model conditioned on class auxiliary data. Synthetic embeddings generated by the diffusion model are combined with seen class embeddings to train a classifier. Experiments are conducted on five environmental audio datasets, ESC-50, ARCA23K-FSD, FSC22, UrbanSound8k and TAU Urban Acoustics 2019, and one music classification dataset, GTZAN. Results show that the diffusion model outperforms all baseline methods on average across six audio datasets. This work establishes the diffusion model as a promising approach for zero-shot learning and introduces the first benchmark of generative methods for zero-shot environmental sound classification, providing a foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

| **[Generative AI-based data augmentation for improved bioacoustic classification in noisy environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01530v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>1. Obtaining data to train robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for species classification can be challenging, particularly for rare species. Data augmentation can boost classification accuracy by increasing the diversity of training data and is cheaper to obtain than expert-labelled data. However, many classic image-based augmentation techniques are not suitable for audio spectrograms. 2. We investigate two generative AI models as data augmentation tools to synthesise spectrograms and supplement audio data: Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The latter performed particularly well in terms of both realism of generated spectrograms and accuracy in a resulting classification task. 3. Alongside these new approaches, we present a new audio data set of 640 hours of bird calls from wind farm sites in Ireland, approximately 800 samples of which have been labelled by experts. Wind farm data are particularly challenging for classification models given the background wind and turbine noise. 4. Training an ensemble of classification models on real and synthetic data combined gave 92.6% accuracy (and 90.5% with just the real data) when compared with highly confident BirdNET predictions. 5. Our approach can be used to augment acoustic signals for more species and other land-use types, and has the potential to bring about a step-change in our capacity to develop reliable AI-based detection of rare species. Our code is available at https://github.com/gibbona1/SpectrogramGenAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Disambiguation Models for Partial Label Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00411v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from ambiguous labels is a long-standing problem in practical machine learning applications. The purpose of \emph{partial label learning} (PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process. Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Representation Consistency Model via Contrastive Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13094v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average. Codes are available at: https://github.com/jiachenlei/rRCM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Simple and Robust Contrastive Explanations for Image Classification by Leveraging Instance Similarity and Concept Relevance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23975v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, KI2025 - 48th German Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Controllable Reference-Based Real-World Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution with Generative Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23801v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image. To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference, we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference, enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Stealthy Adversarial Generation via Latent Optimization and Transferability Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23676v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the "1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-aware Diffusion and Reinforcement Learning for Joint Plane Localization and Anomaly Diagnosis in 3D Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23538v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage, preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis.

| **[Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features for Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23460v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathDiff: Histopathology Image Synthesis with Unpaired Text and Mask Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23440v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints. Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities into a unified conditioning space.

| **[Improving Robustness and Reliability in Medical Image Classification with Latent-Guided Diffusion and Nested-Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15952v5)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once deployed, medical image analysis methods are often faced with unexpected image corruptions and noise perturbations. These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2025</p></details> |

While prior approaches often rely on keyword expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity, interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669 annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993), outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures. Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts, regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI across financial institutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The F...</summary><p>The FinAI-BERT model can be directly loaded via Hugging Face Transformers (https://huggingface.co/bilalzafar/FinAI-BERT) for sentence-level AI disclosure classification</p></details> |

This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises, providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance across all tested scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals, including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization improvements on numerous image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed by a VLM to proactively discover, textually explain, and address conceptual gaps in a deployed predictive model.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

However, their application in medical image generation still faces significant challenges, including small dataset sizes, and scarcity of medical textual data. To address these challenges, we propose Med-Art, a framework specifically designed for medical image generation with limited data. Med-Art leverages vision-language models to generate visual descriptions of medical images which overcomes the scarcity of applicable medical textual data. Med-Art adapts a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model, PixArt-$\alpha$, based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), achieving high performance under limited data. Furthermore, we propose an innovative Hybrid-Level Diffusion Fine-tuning (HLDF) method, which enables pixel-level losses, effectively addressing issues such as overly saturated colors.

These effects significantly reduce image quality, hindering their applicability in downstream tasks such as object detection, mapping, and classification. Our transformer-based diffusion model was developed to address image restoration tasks, aiming to improve the quality of degraded images. This model was evaluated against existing deep learning methodologies across multiple quality metrics for underwater image enhancement, denoising, and deraining on publicly available datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the diffusion model, combined with transformers, surpasses current methods in performance. The results of our model highlight the efficacy of diffusion models and transformers in improving the quality of degraded images, consequently expanding their utility in downstream tasks that require high-fidelity visual data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Momentum-based minimization of the Ginzburg-Landau functional on Euclidean spaces and graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00389v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the momentum-based minimization of a diffuse perimeter functional on Euclidean spaces and on graphs with applications to semi-supervised classification tasks in machine learning. While the gradient flow in the task at hand is a parabolic partial differential equation, the momentum method corresponds to a damped hyperbolic PDE, leading to qualitatively and quantitatively different trajectories. Using a convex-concave splitting-based FISTA-type time discretization, we demonstrate empirically that momentum can lead to faster convergence if the time step size is large but not too large. With large time steps, the PDE analysis offers only limited insight into the geometric behavior of solutions and typical hyperbolic phenomena like loss of regularity are not be observed in sample simulations. We obtain the singular limit of the evolution equations as the length parameter of the phase fields tends to zero by formal expansions and numerically confirm its validity for circles in two dimensions. Our analysis is complemented by numerical experiments for planar curves, surfaces in three-dimensional space, and semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stylized Structural Patterns for Improved Neural Network Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19465v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns, limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data. Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets, enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11% reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a 10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real training sets are not available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Task-oriented Semantic Communications with Model Inversion Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19886v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication has emerged as a promising neural network-based system design for 6G networks. Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel paradigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by transmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task performance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining task accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In such attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by analyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based nature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality indicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be inadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences do not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes semantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with self-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our model also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion to ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio environments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric that better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary. Experimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset, DiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable performance under dynamic channels. Our results further demonstrate that significant deviation exists between traditional image quality indicators and the leakage of task-relevant semantic information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Conceptual Bias via Transformer Latent-Subspace Activation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18887v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models (LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed: per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for concept-level control for practical agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[MeDi: Metadata-Guided Diffusion Models for Mitigating Biases in Tumor Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17140v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice, their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner, hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards better mitigating data biases with generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Category-based Galaxy Image Generation via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16255v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional galaxy generation methods rely on semi-analytical models and hydrodynamic simulations, which are highly dependent on physical assumptions and parameter tuning. In contrast, data-driven generative models do not have explicit physical parameters pre-determined, and instead learn them efficiently from observational data, making them alternative solutions to galaxy generation. Among these, diffusion models outperform Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in quality and diversity. Leveraging physical prior knowledge to these models can further enhance their capabilities. In this work, we present GalCatDiff, the first framework in astronomy to leverage both galaxy image features and astrophysical properties in the network design of diffusion models. GalCatDiff incorporates an enhanced U-Net and a novel block entitled Astro-RAB (Residual Attention Block), which dynamically combines attention mechanisms with convolution operations to ensure global consistency and local feature fidelity. Moreover, GalCatDiff uses category embeddings for class-specific galaxy generation, avoiding the high computational costs of training separate models for each category. Our experimental results demonstrate that GalCatDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of the consistency of sample color and size distributions, and the generated galaxies are both visually realistic and physically consistent. This framework will enhance the reliability of galaxy simulations and can potentially serve as a data augmentor to support future galaxy classification algorithm development.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures.

Conditional Diffusion Model for Galaxy Morphology Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16233v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets -- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features ( $\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical foundation model developments.

| **[Sheaf Hypergraph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17116v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order relations are widespread in nature, with numerous phenomena involving complex interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise connections. As a result, advancements in higher-order processing can accelerate the growth of various fields requiring structured data. Current approaches typically represent these interactions using hypergraphs. We enhance this representation by introducing cellular sheaves for hypergraphs, a mathematical construction that adds extra structure to the conventional hypergraph while maintaining their local, higherorder connectivity. Drawing inspiration from existing Laplacians in the literature, we develop two unique formulations of sheaf hypergraph Laplacians: linear and non-linear. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that incorporating sheaves into the hypergraph Laplacian provides a more expressive inductive bias than standard hypergraph diffusion, creating a powerful instrument for effectively modelling complex data structures. We employ these sheaf hypergraph Laplacians to design two categories of models: Sheaf Hypergraph Neural Networks and Sheaf Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. These models generalize classical Hypergraph Networks often found in the literature. Through extensive experimentation, we show that this generalization significantly improves performance, achieving top results on multiple benchmark datasets for hypergraph node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Diffusion-based Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA), which enhances model robustness and interpretability by generating targeted counterfactual examples. The method navigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with a manifold constraint. The resulting counterfactuals are then used within a self-corrective learning strategy to improve the classifier by focusing on its specific areas of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on the public Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly improves classification accuracy across multiple model architectures. Furthermore, the method provides interpretability by visualizing minimal pathological changes and revealing that the learned latent space topology aligns with clinical knowledge of KOA progression. The DCA framework effectively converts model uncertainty into a robust training signal, offering a promising pathway to developing more accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostic systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZWang78/DCA.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</p></details> |

Non-parametric DM methods struggle with scalability and adversarial DM approaches suffer from instability and mode collapse. While likelihood-based methods are a promising alternative, they often impose unnecessary biases through fixed priors or require explicit density models (e.g., flows) that can be challenging to train. We address this limitation by introducing a novel approach to training likelihood-based DM using expressive score-based prior distributions. Our key insight is that gradient-based DM training only requires the prior's score function -- not its density -- allowing us to train the prior via denoising score matching. This approach eliminates biases from fixed priors (e.g., in VAEs), enabling more effective use of geometry-preserving regularization, while avoiding the challenge of learning an explicit prior density model (e.g., a flow-based prior). Our method also demonstrates better stability and computational efficiency compared to other diffusion-based priors (e.g., LSGM). Furthermore, experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, establishing our score-based method as a stable and effective approach to distribution matching.

However, the paucity of labelled data inhibits classification models' training. Researchers have turned to generative deep learning techniques combined with signal processing to augment the existing data and improve cardiac auscultation classification models to overcome this challenge. However, the primary focus of prior studies has been on model performance as opposed to model robustness. Robustness, in this case, is defined as both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by measures such as Matthew's correlation coefficient. This work shows that more robust abnormal heart sound classifiers can be trained using an augmented dataset. The augmentations consist of traditional audio approaches and the creation of synthetic audio conditionally generated using the WaveGrad and DiffWave diffusion models. It is found that both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance can be improved over various datasets when training a convolutional neural network-based classification model with this augmented dataset. With the performance increase encompassing not only accuracy but also balanced accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient, an augmented dataset significantly contributes to resolving issues of imbalanced datasets. This, in turn, helps provide a more general and robust classifier.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Despite deep models have made significant advances in capturing the discriminative long-term dependency of surgical videos to achieve improved recognition, they rarely account for exploring and modeling the uncertainty in surgical videos, which should be crucial for reliable online surgical phase recognition. We categorize the sources of uncertainty into two types, frame ambiguity in videos and unbalanced distribution among surgical phases, which are inevitable in surgical videos. To address this pivot issue, we introduce a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model (Meta-SurDiff), to take full advantage of the deep generative model and meta-learning in achieving precise frame-level distribution estimation for reliable online surgical phase recognition. For coarse recognition caused by ambiguous video frames, we employ a classification diffusion model to assess the confidence of recognition results at a finer-grained frame-level instance. For coarse recognition caused by unbalanced phase distribution, we use a meta-learning based objective to learn the diffusion model, thus enhancing the robustness of classification boundaries for different surgical phases.We establish effectiveness of Meta-SurDiff in online surgical phase recognition through extensive experiments on five widely used datasets using more than four practical metrics. The datasets include Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD, where OphNet comes from ophthalmic surgeries, NurViD is the daily care dataset, while the others come from laparoscopic surgeries. We will release the code upon acceptance.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

This process is defined as a multimodal classification task. However, gathering a large-scale dataset encompassing both visual and linguistic elements for model training is challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel framework focusing on data augmentation in robotic assistance scenarios, encompassing both dialogues and related environmental imagery. This approach involves leveraging a sophisticated large language model to simulate potential conversations and environmental contexts, followed by the use of a stable diffusion model to create images depicting these environments.

This study focuses on a neuroimaging prediction framework based on both structural and functional neuroimaging data. We propose a next-generation prediction model, \textbf{MultiViT2}, which combines a pretrained representative learning base model with a vision transformer backbone for prediction output. Additionally, we developed a data augmentation module based on the latent diffusion model that enriches input data by generating augmented neuroimaging samples, thereby enhancing predictive performance through reduced overfitting and improved generalizability. We show that MultiViT2 significantly outperforms the first-generation model in schizophrenia classification accuracy and demonstrates strong scalability and portability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic-Powered Predictive Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13432v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification -- augmenting data with synthetic diffusion-model generated images -- and on tabular regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.</p></details> |  |

To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative or Discriminative? Revisiting Text Classification in the Era of Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12181v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints such as latency and data limitations.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11772v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-Aware Edge Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11700v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges persist due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell, {\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics, underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplicity bias and optimization threshold in two-layer ReLU networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02348v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding generalization of overparametrized neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Most of the literature mostly studies generalization from an interpolation point of view, taking convergence of parameters towards a global minimum of the training loss for granted. While overparametrized architectures indeed interpolated the data for typical classification tasks, this interpolation paradigm does not seem valid anymore for more complex tasks such as in-context learning or diffusion. Instead for such tasks, it has been empirically observed that the trained models goes from global minima to spurious local minima of the training loss as the number of training samples becomes larger than some level we call optimization threshold. While the former yields a poor generalization to the true population loss, the latter was observed to actually correspond to the minimiser of this true loss. This paper explores theoretically this phenomenon in the context of two-layer ReLU networks. We demonstrate that, despite overparametrization, networks often converge toward simpler solutions rather than interpolating the training data, which can lead to a drastic improvement on the test loss with respect to interpolating solutions. Our analysis relies on the so called early alignment phase, during which neurons align towards specific directions. This directional alignment, which occurs in the early stage of training, leads to a simplicity bias, wherein the network approximates the ground truth model without converging to the global minimum of the training loss. Our results suggest that this bias, resulting in an optimization threshold from which interpolation is not reached anymore, is beneficial and enhances the generalization of trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML camera ready version</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from seventy-eight percent to ninety-three percent when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, published in Computer and Decision Making - An International Journal (COMDEM)</p></details> |

Despite its effectiveness, existing methods often struggle to comprehensively capture both long-term dynamic evolution and subtle local patterns in a unified manner. In this work, we propose \textbf{TimeDART}, a novel self-supervised time series pre-training framework that unifies two powerful generative paradigms to learn more transferable representations. Specifically, we first employ a causal Transformer encoder, accompanied by a patch-based embedding strategy, to model the evolving trends from left to right. Building on this global modeling, we further introduce a denoising diffusion process to capture fine-grained local patterns through forward diffusion and reverse denoising. Finally, we optimize the model in an autoregressive manner. As a result, TimeDART effectively accounts for both global and local sequence features in a coherent way. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets for time series forecasting and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeDART consistently outperforms previous compared methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/Melmaphother/TimeDART.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, Accepted by the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |

Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements. Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective Data Augmentation With Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07944v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update to ICLR 2024 manuscript (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZWzUA9zeAg), add leafy spurge citations</p></details> |

This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, these models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations, sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without needing access to the original training data. The generated images are sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks, including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the target model.</p></details> |  |
| **[How can Diffusion Models Evolve into Continual Generators?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11936v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in static data generation, their deployment in streaming or continual learning (CL) scenarios faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting (CF), where newly acquired generative capabilities overwrite previously learned ones. To systematically address this, we introduce a formal Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG) paradigm that characterizes and redefines CL in the context of generative diffusion models. Prior efforts often adapt heuristic strategies from continual classification tasks but lack alignment with the underlying diffusion process. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for CDG by analyzing cross-task dynamics in diffusion-based generative modeling. Our analysis reveals that the retention and stability of generative knowledge across tasks are governed by three key consistency criteria: inter-task knowledge consistency (IKC), unconditional knowledge consistency (UKC), and label knowledge consistency (LKC). Building on these insights, we propose Continual Consistency Diffusion (CCD), a principled framework that integrates these consistency objectives into training via hierarchical loss terms $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{LKC}$. This promotes effective knowledge retention while enabling the assimilation of new generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art performance under continual settings, with substantial gains in Mean Fidelity (MF) and Incremental Mean Fidelity (IMF), particularly in tasks with rich cross-task knowledge overlap.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a generative approach based on denoising diffusion models (DMs) to synthesize parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Extending the recent diffusion model pipeline of F\"urrutter et al. [1], our model effectively conditions the synthesis process, enabling the simultaneous generation of circuit architectures and their continuous gate parameters. We demonstrate our approach in synthesizing PQCs optimized for generating high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and achieving high accuracy in quantum machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting the versatility and computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods. This work illustrates the potential of generative models as a powerful tool for accelerating and optimizing the design of PQCs, supporting the development of more practical and scalable quantum applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Diffusing DeBias: Synthetic Bias Amplification for Model Debiasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09564v4)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data whenever they are affected by strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels. This results in a form of bias affecting training data, which typically leads to unrecoverable weak generalization in prediction. This paper aims at facing this problem by leveraging bias amplification with generated synthetic data: we introduce Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods of unsupervised model debiasing exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models in data generation. Specifically, our approach adopts conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, which replace the original training set for learning an effective bias amplifier model that we subsequently incorporate into an end-to-end and a two-step unsupervised debiasing approach. By tackling the fundamental issue of bias-conflicting training samples memorization in learning auxiliary models, typical of this type of techniques, our proposed method beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling bias in deep learning models.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 9 Figures |

This work presents a hybrid machine and deep learning-based approach for classifying malignant and benign skin lesions using the SLICE-3D dataset from ISIC 2024, which comprises 401,059 cropped lesion images extracted from 3D Total Body Photography (TBP), emulating non-dermoscopic, smartphone-like conditions. Our method combines vision transformers (EVA02) and our designed convolutional ViT hybrid (EdgeNeXtSAC) to extract robust features, employing a segmentation-assisted classification pipeline to enhance lesion localization. Predictions from these models are fused with a gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) ensemble enriched by engineered features and patient-specific relational metrics. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we augment malignant cases with Stable Diffusion-generated synthetic lesions and apply a diagnosis-informed relabeling strategy to harmonize external datasets into a 3-class format. Using partial AUC (pAUC) above 80 percent true positive rate (TPR) as the evaluation metric, our approach achieves a pAUC of 0.1755 -- the highest among all configurations. These results underscore the potential of hybrid, interpretable AI systems for skin cancer triage in telemedicine and resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Writt...</summary><p>Written as per the requirements of CVPR 2025.

| **[Learning on Model Weights using Tree Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13569v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of publicly available models is rapidly increasing, yet most remain undocumented. Users looking for suitable models for their tasks must first determine what each model does. Training machine learning models to infer missing documentation directly from model weights is challenging, as these weights often contain significant variation unrelated to model functionality (denoted nuisance). Here, we identify a key property of real-world models: most public models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a tree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model). Importantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation between models. Concretely, while learning across Model Trees requires complex architectures, even a linear classifier trained on a single model layer often works within trees. While effective, these linear classifiers are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with larger models that have many parameters. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a theoretically motivated and lightweight method. Notably, ProbeX is the first probing method specifically designed to learn from the weights of a single hidden model layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbeX by predicting the categories in a model's training dataset based only on its weights. Excitingly, ProbeX can map the weights of Stable Diffusion into a weight-language embedding space, enabling model search via text, i.e., zero-shot model classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Approximate Borderline Sampling using Granular-Ball for Classification Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02366v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling (GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets. Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method and several representative sampling methods.

| **[Synthetic Data Augmentation using Pre-trained Diffusion Models for Long-tailed Food Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01368v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based food image classification enables precise identification of food categories, further facilitating accurate nutritional analysis. However, real-world food images often show a skewed distribution, with some food types being more prevalent than others. This class imbalance can be problematic, causing models to favor the majority (head) classes with overall performance degradation for the less common (tail) classes. Recently, synthetic data augmentation using diffusion-based generative models has emerged as a promising solution to address this issue. By generating high-quality synthetic images, these models can help uniformize the data distribution, potentially improving classification performance. However, existing approaches face challenges: fine-tuning-based methods need a uniformly distributed dataset, while pre-trained model-based approaches often overlook inter-class separation in synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a two-stage synthetic data augmentation framework, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for long-tailed food classification. We generate a reference set conditioned by a positive prompt on the generation target and then select a class that shares similar features with the generation target as a negative prompt. Subsequently, we generate a synthetic augmentation set using positive and negative prompt conditions by a combined sampling strategy that promotes intra-class diversity and inter-class separation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two long-tailed food benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance compared to previous works in terms of top-1 accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing resources may lack the diversity and accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other areas of medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

These representations, to varying extents, can be used for tasks such as downstream classification, controllable generation, and interpolation. However, the generative performance of DAs relies heavily on how well the latent variables can be modelled and subsequently sampled from. Better generative modelling is also the primary goal of another class of diffusion models -- those that learn their forward (noising) process. While effective at adjusting the noise process in an input-dependent manner, they must satisfy additional constraints derived from the terminal conditions of the diffusion process. Here, we draw a connection between these two classes of models and show that certain design decisions (latent variable choice, conditioning method, etc.) in the DA framework -- leading to a model we term DMZ -- allow us to obtain the best of both worlds: effective representations as evaluated on downstream tasks, including domain transfer, as well as more efficient modelling and generation with fewer denoising steps compared to standard DMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 tables, 15 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a transformer-based EEG signal encoder integrating the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the gating mechanism. Guided by the feature alignment and category-aware fusion losses, this encoder is used to extract features related to visual stimuli from EEG signals. Subsequently, with the aid of a pre-trained diffusion model, these features are reconstructed into visual stimuli. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we conducted EEG-to-image generation and classification tasks using the THINGS-EEG dataset. To address the limitations of quantitative analysis at the semantic level, we combined WordNet-based classification and semantic similarity metrics to propose a novel semantic-based score, emphasizing the ability of our model to transfer neural activities into visual representations. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves semantic alignment and classification accuracy, which achieves a maximum single-subject accuracy of 43\%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

| **[From Head to Tail: Towards Balanced Representation in Large Vision-Language Models through Adaptive Data Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12821v4)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in combining visual comprehension with language generation. Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\textbf{DR}$) and $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\textbf{DS}$). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

Specifically, we implement a simplified class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to produce label-consistent samples and explore their integration with real data via two hybrid training strategies: Mix Loss and Mix Representation. While these approaches yield promising validation performance, our proposed MixModel exhibits poor generalization to unseen test data, underscoring the challenges of leveraging synthetic data effectively. In contrast, baseline classifiers built on ResNet backbones with conventional loss functions demonstrate greater stability and test-time performance. Our findings highlight the importance of realistic data generation and robust supervision when incorporating generative augmentation into biomedical image classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Representation Dynamics of Diffusion Models via Low-Dimensional Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05743v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, though originally designed for generative tasks, have demonstrated impressive self-supervised representation learning capabilities. A particularly intriguing phenomenon in these models is the emergence of unimodal representation dynamics, where the quality of learned features peaks at an intermediate noise level. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigation of this phenomenon. Leveraging the inherent low-dimensionality structure of image data, we theoretically demonstrate that the unimodal dynamic emerges when the diffusion model successfully captures the underlying data distribution. The unimodality arises from an interplay between denoising strength and class confidence across noise scales. Empirically, we further show that, in classification tasks, the presence of unimodal dynamics reliably indicates generalization: it emerges when the model generalizes and gradually transitions to a monotonically decreasing curve as the model begins to memorize the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Controllable Diffusion via Optimal Classifier Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21666v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The controllable generation of diffusion models aims to steer the model to generate samples that optimize some given objective functions. It is desirable for a variety of applications including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/sequence generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning of the base model is a popular approach but it can overfit the reward function while requiring significant resources. We frame controllable generation as a problem of finding a distribution that optimizes a KL-regularized objective function. We present SLCD -- Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion, which iteratively generates online data and trains a small classifier to guide the generation of the diffusion model. Similar to the standard classifier-guided diffusion, SLCD's key computation primitive is classification and does not involve any complex concepts from RL or control. Via a reduction to no-regret online learning analysis, we show that under KL divergence, the output from SLCD provably converges to the optimal solution of the KL-regularized objective. Further, we empirically demonstrate that SLCD can generate high quality samples with nearly the same inference time as the base model in both image generation with continuous diffusion and biological sequence generation with discrete diffusion.

Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion models, as a class of emerging generative approaches, have demonstrated promising capabilities in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing tasks. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model are capable of modeling high-dimensional spectral structures, generate high-quality samples, and achieve competitive performance in spectral-spatial denoising tasks and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[NatADiff: Adversarial Boundary Guidance for Natural Adversarial Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20934v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial samples exploit irregularities in the manifold ``learned'' by deep learning models to cause misclassifications. The study of these adversarial samples provides insight into the features a model uses to classify inputs, which can be leveraged to improve robustness against future attacks. However, much of the existing literature focuses on constrained adversarial samples, which do not accurately reflect test-time errors encountered in real-world settings. To address this, we propose `NatADiff', an adversarial sampling scheme that leverages denoising diffusion to generate natural adversarial samples. Our approach is based on the observation that natural adversarial samples frequently contain structural elements from the adversarial class. Deep learning models can exploit these structural elements to shortcut the classification process, rather than learning to genuinely distinguish between classes. To leverage this behavior, we guide the diffusion trajectory towards the intersection of the true and adversarial classes, combining time-travel sampling with augmented classifier guidance to enhance attack transferability while preserving image fidelity. Our method achieves comparable attack success rates to current state-of-the-art techniques, while exhibiting significantly higher transferability across model architectures and better alignment with natural test-time errors as measured by FID. These results demonstrate that NatADiff produces adversarial samples that not only transfer more effectively across models, but more faithfully resemble naturally occurring test-time errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond One-Hot Labels: Semantic Mixing for Model Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13548v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct. However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth uncertainty. Specifically, we present \textbf{Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM)}, a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the state-of-the-art calibration approaches.

| **[Semantic-Space-Intervened Diffusive Alignment for Visual Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05721v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal alignment is an effective approach to improving visual classification. Existing studies typically enforce a one-step mapping that uses deep neural networks to project the visual features to mimic the distribution of textual features. However, they typically face difficulties in finding such a projection due to the two modalities in both the distribution of class-wise samples and the range of their feature values. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Semantic-Space-Intervened Diffusive Alignment method, termed SeDA, models a semantic space as a bridge in the visual-to-textual projection, considering both types of features share the same class-level information in classification. More importantly, a bi-stage diffusion framework is developed to enable the progressive alignment between the two modalities. Specifically, SeDA first employs a Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Learner to model the semantic features space of visual features by constraining the interactive features of the diffusion model and the category centers of visual features. In the later stage of SeDA, the Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Translator focuses on learning the distribution of textual features from the semantic space. Meanwhile, the Progressive Feature Interaction Network introduces stepwise feature interactions at each alignment step, progressively integrating textual information into mapped features. Experimental results show that SeDA achieves stronger cross-modal feature alignment, leading to superior performance over existing methods across multiple scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A vision-intelligent framework for mapping the genealogy of vernacular architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18552v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of vernacular architecture involves recording, ordering, and analysing buildings to probe their physical, social, and cultural explanations. Traditionally, this process is conducted manually and intuitively by researchers. Because human perception is selective and often partial, the resulting interpretations of architecture are invariably broad and loose, often lingering on form descriptions that adhere to a preset linear historical progression or crude regional demarcations. This study proposes a research framework by which intelligent technologies can be systematically assembled to augment researchers' intuition in mapping or uncovering the genealogy of vernacular architecture and its connotative socio-cultural system. We employ this framework to examine the stylistic classification of 1,277 historical shophouses in Singapore's Chinatown. Findings extend beyond the chronological classification established by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore in the 1980s and 1990s, presenting instead a phylogenetic network to capture the formal evolution of shophouses across time and space. The network organises the shophouse types into nine distinct clusters, revealing concurrent evidences of cultural evolution and diffusion. Moreover, it provides a critical perspective on the multi-ethnic character of Singapore shophouses by suggesting that the distinct cultural influences of different ethnic groups led to a pattern of parallel evolution rather than direct convergence. Our work advances a quantitative genealogy of vernacular architecture, which not only assists in formal description but also reveals the underlying forces of development and change. It also exemplified the potential of collaboration between studies in vernacular architecture and computer science, demonstrating how leveraging the strengths of both fields can yield remarkable insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffBreak: Is Diffusion-Based Purification Robust?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16598v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based purification (DBP) has become a cornerstone defense against adversarial examples (AEs), regarded as robust due to its use of diffusion models (DMs) that project AEs onto the natural data manifold. We refute this core claim, theoretically proving that gradient-based attacks effectively target the DM rather than the classifier, causing DBP's outputs to align with adversarial distributions. This prompts a reassessment of DBP's robustness, attributing it to two critical flaws: incorrect gradients and inappropriate evaluation protocols that test only a single random purification of the AE. We show that with proper accounting for stochasticity and resubmission risk, DBP collapses. To support this, we introduce DiffBreak, the first reliable toolkit for differentiation through DBP, eliminating gradient flaws that previously further inflated robustness estimates. We also analyze the current defense scheme used for DBP where classification relies on a single purification, pinpointing its inherent invalidity. We provide a statistically grounded majority-vote (MV) alternative that aggregates predictions across multiple purified copies, showing partial but meaningful robustness gain. We then propose a novel adaptation of an optimization method against deepfake watermarking, crafting systemic perturbations that defeat DBP even under MV, challenging DBP's viability.</p></details> |  |

The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool for medical AI applications.</p></details> |  |

Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Prior work takes a step towards understanding disentanglement in VAEs by showing diagonal posterior covariance matrices promote orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. Building on this, we close the gap in our understanding of disentanglement by showing how if follows from such orthogonality and equates to factoring the data distribution into statistically independent components.</p></details> |  |

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the right-skewed asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix; v2: slight improvement in presentation.

However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3) No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets, significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.</p></details> | 14pages,15 figures |

Current research explores various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet, its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%. Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to be addressed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at the 33rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2025)</p></details> |
| **[KO: Kinetics-inspired Neural Optimizer with PDE Simulation Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14777v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of optimization algorithms for neural networks remains a critical challenge, with most existing methods relying on heuristic adaptations of gradient-based approaches. This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains comparable.</p></details> |  |

However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods, Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role: diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time for training generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowPure: Continuous Normalizing Flows for Adversarial Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13280v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in the area, adversarial robustness remains a critical challenge in systems employing machine learning models. The removal of adversarial perturbations at inference time, known as adversarial purification, has emerged as a promising defense strategy. To achieve this, state-of-the-art methods leverage diffusion models that inject Gaussian noise during a forward process to dilute adversarial perturbations, followed by a denoising step to restore clean samples before classification. In this work, we propose FlowPure, a novel purification method based on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) trained with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to learn mappings from adversarial examples to their clean counterparts. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that rely on fixed noise processes, FlowPure can leverage specific attack knowledge to improve robustness under known threats, while also supporting a more general stochastic variant trained on Gaussian perturbations for settings where such knowledge is unavailable. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art purification-based defenses in preprocessor-blind and white-box scenarios, and can do so while fully preserving benign accuracy in the former. Moreover, our results show that not only is FlowPure a highly effective purifier but it also holds a strong potential for adversarial detection, identifying preprocessor-blind PGD samples with near-perfect accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In computer vision, this translates into a classification problem, where knowledge from seen categories is transferred to unseen categories by exploiting the relationships between visual features and available semantic information, such as text corpora or manual annotations. However, learning this joint distribution is costly and requires one-to-one training with corresponding semantic information. We present a reversed conditional Diffusion-based model (RevCD) that mitigates this issue by generating semantic features synthesized from visual inputs by leveraging Diffusion models' conditional mechanisms. Our RevCD model consists of a cross Hadamard-Addition embedding of a sinusoidal time schedule and a multi-headed visual transformer for attention-guided embeddings. The proposed approach introduces three key innovations. First, we reverse the process of generating semantic space based on visual data, introducing a novel loss function that facilitates more efficient knowledge transfer. Second, we apply Diffusion models to zero-shot learning - a novel approach that exploits their strengths in capturing data complexity. Third, we demonstrate our model's performance through a comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation.

One potential solution is to generate synthetic images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy. However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to 78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations, enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and facilitating medical diagnosis and research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%.

| **[Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2025</p></details> |

Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</p></details> |

This study focuses on a neuroimaging prediction framework based on both structural and functional neuroimaging data. We propose a next-generation prediction model, \textbf{MultiViT2}, which combines a pretrained representative learning base model with a vision transformer backbone for prediction output. Additionally, we developed a data augmentation module based on the latent diffusion model that enriches input data by generating augmented neuroimaging samples, thereby enhancing predictive performance through reduced overfitting and improved generalizability. We show that MultiViT2 significantly outperforms the first-generation model in schizophrenia classification accuracy and demonstrates strong scalability and portability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Doctor Approved: Generating Medically Accurate Skin Disease Images through AI-Expert Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12323v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.</p></details> |  |

However, existing resources may lack the diversity and accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other areas of medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool for medical AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Bridge Models for 3D Medical Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15267v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides crucial insights into the microstructure of the human brain, but it can be time-consuming to acquire compared to more readily available T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion bridge model for 3D brain image translation between T1w MRI and DTI modalities. Our model learns to generate high-quality DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) images from T1w images and vice versa, enabling cross-modality data augmentation and reducing the need for extensive DTI acquisition. We evaluate our approach using perceptual similarity, pixel-level agreement, and distributional consistency metrics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing anatomical structures and preserving information on white matter integrity. The practical utility of the synthetic data is validated through sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks, where the generated images achieve comparable performance to real data. Our diffusion bridge model offers a promising solution for improving neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical decision-making, with the potential to significantly impact neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, current research on optimization algorithms in federated learning often focuses on limited datasets and scenarios, primarily centered around natural images, with insufficient comparative experiments in medical contexts. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms in the context of medical imaging. We conduct a fair comparison of classification models trained using various federated learning algorithms across multiple medical imaging datasets. Additionally, we evaluate system performance metrics, such as communication cost and computational efficiency, while considering different federated learning architectures. Our findings show that medical imaging datasets pose substantial challenges for current federated learning optimization algorithms. No single algorithm consistently delivers optimal performance across all medical federated learning scenarios, and many optimization algorithms may underperform when applied to these datasets. Our experiments provide a benchmark and guidance for future research and application of federated learning in medical imaging contexts. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and robust method that combines generative techniques using denoising diffusion probabilistic models with label smoothing to augment datasets, widely enhancing the performance of federated learning on classification tasks across various medical imaging datasets. Our code will be released on GitHub, offering a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for future federated learning studies in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the datasets PAD-UFES-20 for skin cancer and P-NDB-UFES for oral cancer, the diffusion model demonstrated competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Specifically, for the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, the model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.6457 for six-class classification and 0.8357 for binary classification (cancer vs. non-cancer). For the P-NDB-UFES dataset, it attained a balanced accuracy of 0.9050. These results suggest that diffusion models are viable models for classifying medical images of skin and oral lesions. In addition, we investigate the robustness of the model trained on PAD-UFES-20 for skin cancer but tested on the clinical images of the HIBA dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, the challenge of noisy labels and limited high-quality datasets remains underexplored. To address this, we establish the first benchmark for noisy labels in Med-VQA by simulating human mislabeling with semantically designed noise types. More importantly, we introduce the DiN framework, which leverages a diffusion model to handle noisy labels in Med-VQA. Unlike the dominant classification-based VQA approaches that directly predict answers, our Answer Diffuser (AD) module employs a coarse-to-fine process, refining answer candidates with a diffusion model for improved accuracy. The Answer Condition Generator (ACG) further enhances this process by generating task-specific conditional information via integrating answer embeddings with fused image-question features. To address label noise, our Noisy Label Refinement(NLR) module introduces a robust loss function and dynamic answer adjustment to further boost the performance of the AD module.</p></details> |  |

Our key innovation lies in leveraging DDPMs for self-supervised pre-training in landmark detection, a previously unexplored approach in this domain. This method enables accurate landmark detection with minimal annotated training data (as few as 50 images), surpassing both ImageNet supervised pre-training and traditional self-supervised techniques across three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[FedBiP: Heterogeneous One-Shot Federated Learning with Personalized Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04810v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL), a special decentralized machine learning paradigm, has recently gained significant attention. OSFL requires only a single round of client data or model upload, which reduces communication costs and mitigates privacy threats compared to traditional FL. Despite these promising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data heterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL systems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on large-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these issues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results in significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance degradation in classification models trained on such data. This issue is particularly pronounced in rare domains, such as medical imaging, which are underrepresented in LDM's pretraining data. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the pretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP synthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without compromising the privacy regulations. FedBiP is also the first approach to simultaneously address feature space heterogeneity and client data scarcity in OSFL. Our method is validated through extensive experiments on three OSFL benchmarks with feature space heterogeneity, as well as on challenging medical and satellite image datasets with label heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiP, which substantially outperforms other OSFL methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Deep learning models for thyroid scintigraphy classification often face challenges due to limited and imbalanced datasets, leading to suboptimal generalization. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of different data augmentation techniques including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA) to enhance the performance of a ResNet18 classifier for thyroid condition classification. Our results showed that FM-based augmentation consistently outperforms SD-based approaches, particularly when combined with original (O) data and CA (O+FM+CA), achieving both high accuracy and fair classification across Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI) cases. The Wilcoxon statistical analysis further validated the superiority of O+FM and its variants (O+FM+CA) over SD-based augmentations in most scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of FM-based augmentation as a superior approach for generating high-quality synthetic thyroid scintigraphy images and improving model generalization in medical image classification.</p></details> |  |

However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications.

| **[Explainable, Multi-modal Wound Infection Classification from Images Augmented with Generated Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20277v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infections in Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) can cause severe complications, including tissue death and limb amputation, highlighting the need for accurate, timely diagnosis. Previous machine learning methods have focused on identifying infections by analyzing wound images alone, without utilizing additional metadata such as medical notes. In this study, we aim to improve infection detection by introducing Synthetic Caption Augmented Retrieval for Wound Infection Detection (SCARWID), a novel deep learning framework that leverages synthetic textual descriptions to augment DFU images. SCARWID consists of two components: (1) Wound-BLIP, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on GPT-4o-generated descriptions to synthesize consistent captions from images; and (2) an Image-Text Fusion module that uses cross-attention to extract cross-modal embeddings from an image and its corresponding Wound-BLIP caption. Infection status is determined by retrieving the top-k similar items from a labeled support set. To enhance the diversity of training data, we utilized a latent diffusion model to generate additional wound images. As a result, SCARWID outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively, for wound infection classification. Displaying the generated captions alongside the wound images and infection detection results enhances interpretability and trust, enabling nurses to align SCARWID outputs with their medical knowledge. This is particularly valuable when wound notes are unavailable or when assisting novice nurses who may find it difficult to identify visual attributes of wound infection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Polyp Detection and Diagnosis through Compositional Prompt-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17951v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern, and early detection through screening plays a critical role in reducing mortality. While deep learning models have shown promise in improving polyp detection, classification, and segmentation, their generalization across diverse clinical environments, particularly with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, remains a challenge. Multi-center datasets like PolypGen have been developed to address these issues, but their collection is costly and time-consuming. Traditional data augmentation techniques provide limited variability, failing to capture the complexity of medical images. Diffusion models have emerged as a promising solution for generating synthetic polyp images, but the image generation process in current models mainly relies on segmentation masks as the condition, limiting their ability to capture the full clinical context. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Progressive Spectrum Diffusion Model (PSDM) that integrates diverse clinical annotations-such as segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and colonoscopy reports-by transforming them into compositional prompts. These prompts are organized into coarse and fine components, allowing the model to capture both broad spatial structures and fine details, generating clinically accurate synthetic images. By augmenting training data with PSDM-generated samples, our model significantly improves polyp detection, classification, and segmentation. For instance, on the PolypGen dataset, PSDM increases the F1 score by 2.12% and the mean average precision by 3.09%, demonstrating superior performance in OOD scenarios and enhanced generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: "Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?" To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained exclusively on synthetic data outperform those trained on real data by 3.8% in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of 9.07%. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.</p></details> | Under Review |

Morphological factors such as size, location, texture, and variable appearance complicate tumor inspection. Medical imaging presents challenges, including noise and incomplete images. This research article presents a methodology for processing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, encompassing techniques for image classification and denoising. The effective use of MRI images allows medical professionals to detect brain disorders, including tumors. This research aims to categorize healthy brain tissue and brain tumors by analyzing the provided MRI data. Unlike alternative methods like Computed Tomography (CT), MRI technology offers a more detailed representation of internal anatomical components, making it a suitable option for studying data related to brain tumors. The MRI picture is first subjected to a denoising technique utilizing an Anisotropic diffusion filter. The dataset utilized for the models creation is a publicly accessible and validated Brain Tumour Classification (MRI) database, comprising 3,264 brain MRI scans. SMOTE was employed for data augmentation and dataset balancing. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) such as ResNet152V2, VGG, ViT, and EfficientNet were employed for the classification procedure. EfficientNet attained an accuracy of 98%, the highest recorded.</p></details> |  |

However, the creation of high-quality annotated datasets for training remains a major challenge. This study introduces a novel single-stage approach (HistoSmith) for generating image-label pairs to augment histology datasets. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with separate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a latent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts, classification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data generation by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types, quantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset and the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and diverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell instance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented cell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.</p></details> |  |

Image generation has immense potential in medical imaging because open-source medical images are difficult to obtain compared to natural images, especially for rare conditions. The generated images can be used later to train classification and segmentation models. In this paper, we propose simulating realistic ultrasound (US) images by successive fine-tuning of large diffusion models on different publicly available databases. To do so, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, on BUSI (Breast US Images) an ultrasound breast image dataset. We successfully generated high-quality US images of the breast using simple prompts that specify the organ and pathology, which appeared realistic to three experienced US scientists and a US radiologist. Additionally, we provided user control by conditioning the model with segmentations through ControlNet. We will release the source code at http://code.sonography.ai/ to allow fast US image generation to the scientific community.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages conference paper for SPIE medical imaging</p></details> |
| **[Diverse Image Generation with Diffusion Models and Cross Class Label Learning for Polyp Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05444v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologic diagnosis is a critical phase in deciding the optimal treatment procedure for dealing with colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/Vanshali/PathoPolyp-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Diffusion Models are Medical Image Classifiers that Provide Explainability and Uncertainty for Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03687v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

However, as the text to nature image models, we show that the T2MedI model can also bias to some subgroups to overlook the minority ones in the training set. In this work, we first build a T2MedI model based on the pre-trained Imagen model, which has the fixed contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) text encoder, while its decoder has been fine-tuned on medical images from the Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset. Its gender bias is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Toward this issue, we propose to fine-tune the T2MedI toward the target application dataset to align their sensitive subgroups distribution probability. Specifically, the alignment loss for fine-tuning is guided by an off-the-shelf sensitivity-subgroup classifier to match the classification probability between the generated images and the expected target dataset. In addition, the image quality is maintained by a CLIP-consistency regularization term following a knowledge distillation scheme. For evaluation, we set the target dataset to be enhanced as the BraST18 dataset, and trained a brain magnetic resonance (MR) slice-based gender classifier from it. With our method, the generated MR image can markedly reduce the inconsistency with the gender proportion in the BraTS18 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

However, manual assessments are subjective and prone to variability. In response, we introduce FDDM, a novel framework bridging the gap between patch classification and region-based segmentation. FDDM operates in two stages: patch-based classification, followed by region-based refinement, enabling cross-patch information intergation. Leveraging a newly curated dataset of osteosarcoma images, FDDM demonstrates superior segmentation performance, achieving up to a 10% improvement mIOU and a 32.12% enhancement in necrosis rate estimation over state-of-the-art methods. This framework sets a new benchmark in osteosarcoma assessment, highlighting the potential of foundation models and diffusion-based refinements in complex medical imaging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion-Based Approaches in Medical Image Generation and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16860v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scarcity in medical imaging poses significant challenges due to privacy concerns. Diffusion models, a recent generative modeling technique, offer a potential solution by generating synthetic and realistic data. However, questions remain about the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on original and synthetic datasets. If diffusion-generated samples can help CNN models perform comparably to those trained on original datasets, reliance on patient-specific data for training CNNs might be reduced. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of diffusion models for generating synthetic medical images to train CNNs in three domains: Brain Tumor MRI, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), and SARS-CoV-2 CT scans. A diffusion model was trained to generate synthetic datasets for each domain. Pre-trained CNN architectures were then trained on these synthetic datasets and evaluated on unseen real data. All three datasets achieved promising classification performance using CNNs trained on synthetic data. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) analysis revealed that the models focused on relevant image features for classification. This study demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to generate synthetic medical images for training CNNs in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this study explores the use of generative models, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Progressive Growing Generative Adversarial Networks (PGGANs), for dataset augmentation. The research introduces a framework to assess the impact of synthetic images generated by DDPM and PGGANs on the performance of four models: a custom CNN, Untrained VGG16, Pretrained VGG16, and Pretrained ResNet50. Experiments were conducted using Random Sampling and Greedy K Sampling to create small, imbalanced datasets. The synthetic images were evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and compared to original datasets through classification metrics. The results show that DDPM consistently generated more realistic images with lower FID scores and significantly outperformed PGGANs in improving classification metrics across all models and datasets. Incorporating DDPM-generated images into the original datasets increased accuracy by up to 6%, enhancing model robustness and stability, particularly in imbalanced scenarios. Random Sampling demonstrated superior stability, while Greedy K Sampling offered diversity at the cost of higher FID scores. This study highlights the efficacy of DDPM in augmenting small, imbalanced medical image datasets, improving model performance by balancing the dataset and expanding its size.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAug: Diffusion-based Channel Augmentation for Radiology Image Retrieval and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04828v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image understanding requires meticulous examination of fine visual details, with particular regions requiring additional attention. While radiologists build such expertise over years of experience, it is challenging for AI models to learn where to look with limited amounts of training data. This limitation results in unsatisfying robustness in medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion-based Feature Augmentation (DAug), a portable method that improves a perception model's performance with a generative model's output. Specifically, we extend a radiology image to multiple channels, with the additional channels being the heatmaps of regions where diseases tend to develop. A diffusion-based image-to-image translation model was used to generate such heatmaps conditioned on selected disease classes. Our method is motivated by the fact that generative models learn the distribution of normal and abnormal images, and such knowledge is complementary to image understanding tasks. In addition, we propose the Image-Text-Class Hybrid Contrastive learning to utilize both text and class labels. With two novel approaches combined, our method surpasses baseline models without changing the model architecture, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both medical image retrieval and classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Generative Classification of Blood Cell Morphology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08982v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of haematological cells is critical for diagnosing blood disorders, but presents significant challenges for machine automation owing to the complexity of cell morphology, heterogeneities of biological, pathological, and imaging characteristics, and the imbalance of cell type frequencies. We introduce CytoDiffusion, a diffusion-based classifier that effectively models blood cell morphology, combining accurate classification with robust anomaly detection, resistance to distributional shifts, interpretability, data efficiency, and superhuman uncertainty quantification. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative models in anomaly detection (AUC 0.990 vs. 0.918), resistance to domain shifts (85.85% vs. 74.38% balanced accuracy), and performance in low-data regimes (95.88% vs. 94.95% balanced accuracy). Notably, our model generates synthetic blood cell images that are nearly indistinguishable from real images, as demonstrated by an authenticity test in which expert haematologists achieved only 52.3% accuracy (95% CI: [50.5%, 54.2%]) in distinguishing real from generated images. Furthermore, we enhance model explainability through the generation of directly interpretable counterfactual heatmaps. Our comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing these multiple performance dimensions, establishes a new benchmark for medical image analysis in haematology, ultimately enabling improved diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.

This paper introduces Diffusion-Driven Diagnosis (D-Cube), a novel approach that leverages hyper-features from a diffusion model combined with contrastive learning to improve cancer diagnosis. D-Cube employs advanced feature selection techniques that utilize the robust representational capabilities of diffusion models, enhancing classification performance on medical datasets under challenging conditions such as data imbalance and limited sample availability. The feature selection process optimizes the extraction of clinically relevant features, significantly improving classification accuracy and demonstrating resilience in imbalanced and limited data scenarios. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of D-Cube across multiple medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and X-ray, showing superior performance compared to existing baseline models. D-Cube represents a new strategy in cancer detection, employing advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

This is especially problematic in medical settings, where biased models fail when applied to different hospitals or systems. In such cases, data-driven methods to reduce spurious correlations are preferred, as clinicians can directly validate the modified images. While Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Diffusion Models) show promise for natural images, they are impractical for medical use due to the difficulty of describing spurious medical features. To address this, we propose Masked Medical Image Inpainting (MaskMedPaint), which uses text-to-image diffusion models to augment training images by inpainting areas outside key classification regions to match the target domain. We demonstrate that MaskMedPaint enhances generalization to target domains across both natural (Waterbirds, iWildCam) and medical (ISIC 2018, Chest X-ray) datasets, given limited unlabeled target images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 12 pages</p></details> |

The medical imaging domain faces unique challenges due to scarce data labelling -- insufficient for standard training, and critical nature of the applications that require high performance, confidence, and explainability of the models. In this work, we propose to tackle those challenges with a single model that combines standard classification with a diffusion-based generative task in a single shared parametrisation. By sharing representations, our model effectively learns from both labeled and unlabeled data while at the same time providing accurate explanations through counterfactual examples. In our experiments, we show that our Mediffusion achieves results comparable to recent semi-supervised methods while providing more reliable and precise explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extrapolating Prospective Glaucoma Fundus Images through Diffusion Model in Irregular Longitudinal Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21130v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utilization of longitudinal datasets for glaucoma progression prediction offers a compelling approach to support early therapeutic interventions. Predominant methodologies in this domain have primarily focused on the direct prediction of glaucoma stage labels from longitudinal datasets. However, such methods may not adequately encapsulate the nuanced developmental trajectory of the disease. To enhance the diagnostic acumen of medical practitioners, we propose a novel diffusion-based model to predict prospective images by extrapolating from existing longitudinal fundus images of patients. The methodology delineated in this study distinctively leverages sequences of images as inputs. Subsequently, a time-aligned mask is employed to select a specific year for image generation. During the training phase, the time-aligned mask resolves the issue of irregular temporal intervals in longitudinal image sequence sampling. Additionally, we utilize a strategy of randomly masking a frame in the sequence to establish the ground truth. This methodology aids the network in continuously acquiring knowledge regarding the internal relationships among the sequences throughout the learning phase. Moreover, the introduction of textual labels is instrumental in categorizing images generated within the sequence. The empirical findings from the conducted experiments indicate that our proposed model not only effectively generates longitudinal data but also significantly improves the precision of downstream classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BIBM 2024</p></details> |

Although current medical TTI methods have made some progress in report-to-Chest-Xray (CXR) generation, their generation performance may be limited due to the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel disease-knowledge enhanced Diffusion-based TTI learning framework, named Diff-CXR, for medical report-to-CXR generation. First, to minimize the negative impacts of noisy data on generation, we devise a Latent Noise Filtering Strategy that gradually learns the general patterns of anomalies and removes them in the latent space. Then, an Adaptive Vision-Aware Textual Learning Strategy is designed to learn concise and important report embeddings in a domain-specific Vision-Language Model, providing textual guidance for Chest-Xray generation. Finally, by incorporating the general disease knowledge into the pretrained TTI model via a delicate control adapter, a disease-knowledge enhanced diffusion model is introduced to achieve realistic and precise report-to-CXR generation. Experimentally, our Diff-CXR outperforms previous SOTA medical TTI methods by 33.4\% / 8.0\% and 23.8\% / 56.4\% in the FID and mAUC score on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray, with the lowest computational complexity at 29.641 GFLOPs. Downstream experiments on three thorax disease classification benchmarks and one CXR-report generation benchmark demonstrate that Diff-CXR is effective in improving classical CXR analysis methods. Notably, models trained on the combination of 1\% real data and synthetic data can achieve a competitive mAUC score compared to models trained on all data, presenting promising clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Common CE approaches require an additional model and are typically constrained to binary counterfactuals. In contrast, we propose a novel method that operates directly on the latent space of a generative model, specifically a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE). This approach offers inherent interpretability by enabling the generation of CEs and the continuous visualization of the model's internal representation across decision boundaries. Our method leverages the DAE's ability to encode images into a semantically rich latent space in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled data or separate feature extraction models. We show that these latent representations are helpful for medical condition classification and the ordinal regression of severity pathologies, such as vertebral compression fractures (VCF) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Beyond binary CEs, our method supports the visualization of ordinal CEs using a linear model, providing deeper insights into the model's decision-making process and enhancing interpretability. Experiments across various medical imaging datasets demonstrate the method's advantages in interpretability and versatility. The linear manifold of the DAE's latent space allows for meaningful interpolation and manipulation, making it a powerful tool for exploring medical image properties.

Despite the recent success of text-to-image diffusion models, text descriptions are often found to be inadequate and fail to convey detailed disease-specific information to these models to generate clinically accurate images. The anatomy, disease texture patterns, and location of the disease are extremely important to generate realistic images; moreover the fidelity of image generation can have significant implications in downstream tasks involving disease diagnosis or treatment repose assessment. Hence, there is a growing need to carefully define the controls used in diffusion models for medical image generation. Eye gaze patterns of radiologists are important visuo-cognitive information, indicative of subtle disease patterns and spatial location. Radiomic features further provide important subvisual cues regarding disease phenotype. In this work, we propose to use these gaze patterns in combination with standard radiomics descriptors, as controls, to generate anatomically correct and disease-aware medical images. RadGazeGen is evaluated for image generation quality and diversity on the REFLACX dataset. To demonstrate clinical applicability, we also show classification performance on the generated images from the CheXpert test set (n=500) and long-tailed learning performance on the MIMIC-CXR-LT test set (n=23550).</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Imbalanced Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14313v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data often has a long-tailed distribution, where the scarcity of tail samples significantly limits the model's generalization ability. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are generative models based on stochastic differential equation theory and have demonstrated impressive performance in image classification tasks. However, existing diffusion probabilistic models do not perform satisfactorily in classifying tail classes. In this work, we propose the Anisotropic Diffusion Probabilistic Model (ADPM) for imbalanced image classification problems. We utilize the data distribution to control the diffusion speed of different class samples during the forward process, effectively improving the classification accuracy of the denoiser in the reverse process. Specifically, we provide a theoretical strategy for selecting noise levels for different categories in the diffusion process based on error analysis theory to address the imbalanced classification problem. Furthermore, we integrate global and local image prior in the forward process to enhance the model's discriminative ability in the spatial dimension, while incorporate semantic-level contextual information in the reverse process to boost the model's discriminative power and robustness. Through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on four medical benchmark datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling long-tail data. Our results confirm that the anisotropic diffusion model significantly improves the classification accuracy of rare classes while maintaining the accuracy of head classes. On the skin lesion datasets, PAD-UFES and HAM10000, the F1-scores of our method improved by 4% and 3%, respectively compared to the original diffusion probabilistic model.</p></details> |  |

While inference with these systems on consumer-grade GPUs is increasingly feasible, training from scratch requires large captioned datasets and significant computational resources. In medical image generation, the limited availability of large, publicly accessible datasets with text reports poses challenges due to legal and ethical concerns. This work shows that adapting pre-trained Stable Diffusion models to medical imaging modalities is achievable by training text embeddings using Textual Inversion. In this study, we experimented with small medical datasets (100 samples each from three modalities) and trained within hours to generate diagnostically accurate images, as judged by an expert radiologist. Experiments with Textual Inversion training and inference parameters reveal the necessity of larger embeddings and more examples in the medical domain. Classification experiments show an increase in diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, from 0.78 to 0.80. Further experiments demonstrate embedding flexibility through disease interpolation, combining pathologies, and inpainting for precise disease appearance control. The trained embeddings are compact (less than 1 MB), enabling easy data sharing with reduced privacy concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MIDL 2024</p></details> |

This distribution presents a significant challenge because rare conditions are critical to detect and difficult to classify due to limited data. In this paper, rather than attempting to classify rare classes, we aim to detect these as out-of-distribution data reliably. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem. We significantly improve the OOD detection performance on a challenging histopathological task with only ten samples per tail class without losing classification accuracy on the head classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving EEG Classification Through Randomly Reassembling Original and Generated Data with Transformer-based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20253v2)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has been widely used in various medical and engineering applications, where it is important for understanding brain function, diagnosing diseases, and assessing mental health conditions. However, the scarcity of EEG data severely restricts the performance of EEG classification networks, and generative model-based data augmentation methods have emerged as potential solutions to overcome this challenge. There are two problems with existing methods: (1) The quality of the generated EEG signals is not high; (2) The enhancement of EEG classification networks is not effective. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a generated data-based augmentation method to address the above two problems. For the characteristics of EEG signals, we propose a constant-factor scaling method to preprocess the signals, which reduces the loss of information. We incorporated Multi-Scale Convolution and Dynamic Fourier Spectrum Information modules into the model, improving the stability of the training process and the quality of the generated data. The proposed augmentation method randomly reassemble the generated data with original data in the time-domain to obtain vicinal data, which improves the model performance by minimizing the empirical risk and the vicinal risk. We verify the proposed augmentation method on four EEG datasets for four tasks and observe significant accuracy performance improvements: 14.00% on the Bonn dataset; 6.38% on the SleepEDF-20 dataset; 9.42% on the FACED dataset; 2.5% on the Shu dataset. We will make the code of our method publicly accessible soon.</p></details> |  |

In the medical domain, images containing temporal data are frequently utilized to study temporal dynamics and statistically monitor disease progression. While deep learning-based generative models for natural images have been widely researched, there are comparatively few methods available for synthesizing temporal knee X-rays. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning model designed to synthesize intermediate X-ray images between a specific patient's healthy knee and severe KOA stages. During the testing phase, based on a healthy knee X-ray, the proposed model can produce a continuous and effective sequence of KOA X-ray images with varying degrees of severity. Specifically, we introduce a Diffusion-based Morphing Model by modifying the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Our approach integrates diffusion and morphing modules, enabling the model to capture spatial morphing details between source and target knee X-ray images and synthesize intermediate frames along a geodesic path. A hybrid loss consisting of diffusion loss, morphing loss, and supervision loss was employed. We demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the highest temporal frame synthesis performance, effectively augmenting data for classification models and simulating the progression of KOA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Sample Quality via the Latent Space of Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15171v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in generative models increase the need for sample quality assessment. To do so, previous methods rely on a pre-trained feature extractor to embed the generated samples and real samples into a common space for comparison. However, different feature extractors might lead to inconsistent assessment outcomes. Moreover, these methods are not applicable for domains where a robust, universal feature extractor does not yet exist, such as medical images or 3D assets. In this paper, we propose to directly examine the latent space of the trained generative model to infer generated sample quality. This is feasible because the quality a generated sample directly relates to the amount of training data resembling it, and we can infer this information by examining the density of the latent space. Accordingly, we use a latent density score function to quantify sample quality. We show that the proposed score correlates highly with the sample quality for various generative models including VAEs, GANs and Latent Diffusion Models. Compared with previous quality assessment methods, our method has the following advantages: 1) pre-generation quality estimation with reduced computational cost, 2) generalizability to various domains and modalities, and 3) applicability to latent-based image editing and generation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods can benefit downstream tasks such as few-shot image classification and latent face image editing.

| **[GenMix: Combining Generative and Mixture Data Augmentation for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20650v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique called GenMix, which combines generative and mixture approaches to leverage the strengths of both methods. While generative models excel at creating new data patterns, they face challenges such as mode collapse in GANs and difficulties in training diffusion models, especially with limited medical imaging data. On the other hand, mixture models enhance class boundary regions but tend to favor the major class in scenarios with class imbalance. To address these limitations, GenMix integrates both approaches to complement each other. GenMix operates in two stages: (1) training a generative model to produce synthetic images, and (2) performing mixup between synthetic and real data. This process improves the quality and diversity of synthetic data while simultaneously benefiting from the new pattern learning of generative models and the boundary enhancement of mixture models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) in CT images. Our results demonstrate that GenMix enhances the performance of various generative models, including DCGAN, StyleGAN, Textual Inversion, and Diffusion Models. Notably, the proposed method with Textual Inversion outperforms other methods without fine-tuning diffusion model on the FLL dataset.</p></details> |  |

Scaling Medical Diffusion via Self-Supervised Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11594v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful foundation models for a variety of tasks, with a large focus in synthetic image generation. However, their requirement of large annotated datasets for training limits their applicability in medical imaging, where datasets are typically smaller and sparsely annotated. We introduce DiNO-Diffusion, a self-supervised method for training latent diffusion models (LDMs) that conditions the generation process on image embeddings extracted from DiNO. By eliminating the reliance on annotations, our training leverages over 868k unlabelled images from public chest X-Ray (CXR) datasets. Despite being self-supervised, DiNO-Diffusion shows comprehensive manifold coverage, with FID scores as low as 4.7, and emerging properties when evaluated in downstream tasks. It can be used to generate semantically-diverse synthetic datasets even from small data pools, demonstrating up to 20% AUC increase in classification performance when used for data augmentation. Images were generated with different sampling strategies over the DiNO embedding manifold and using real images as a starting point. Results suggest, DiNO-Diffusion could facilitate the creation of large datasets for flexible training of downstream AI models from limited amount of real data, while also holding potential for privacy preservation. Additionally, DiNO-Diffusion demonstrates zero-shot segmentation performance of up to 84.4% Dice score when evaluating lung lobe segmentation. This evidences good CXR image-anatomy alignment, akin to segmenting using textual descriptors on vanilla DMs. Finally, DiNO-Diffusion can be easily adapted to other medical imaging modalities or state-of-the-art diffusion models, opening the door for large-scale, multi-domain image generation pipelines for medical imaging.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Without directly comparable methods in 3D medical imaging, we benchmarked GenerateCT against cutting-edge methods, demonstrating its superiority across all key metrics. Importantly, we evaluated GenerateCT's clinical applications in a multi-abnormality classification task. First, we established a baseline by training a multi-abnormality classifier on our real dataset. To further assess the model's generalization to external data and performance with unseen prompts in a zero-shot scenario, we employed an external set to train the classifier, setting an additional benchmark. We conducted two experiments in which we doubled the training datasets by synthesizing an equal number of volumes for each set using GenerateCT. The first experiment demonstrated an 11% improvement in the AP score when training the classifier jointly on real and generated volumes. The second experiment showed a 7% improvement when training on both real and generated volumes based on unseen prompts. Moreover, GenerateCT enables the scaling of synthetic training datasets to arbitrary sizes. As an example, we generated 100,000 3D CTs, fivefold the number in our real set, and trained the classifier exclusively on these synthetic CTs. Impressively, this classifier surpassed the performance of the one trained on all available real data by a margin of 8%. Last, domain experts evaluated the generated volumes, confirming a high degree of alignment with the text prompt.

However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging. It may pave the way for more accessible and cost-effective advanced diagnostic tools.

As deep learning techniques prove successful in the medical domain, the primary challenges become limited data availability and concerns about data sharing and privacy. Federated learning has addressed this challenge by training models locally and updating parameters on a server. However, issues, such as domain shift and bias, persist and impact overall performance. Dataset distillation presents an alternative approach to overcoming these challenges. It involves creating a small synthetic dataset that encapsulates essential information, which can be shared without constraints. At present, this paradigm is not practicable as current distillation approaches only generate non human readable representations and exhibit insufficient performance for downstream learning tasks. We train a latent diffusion model and construct a new distilled synthetic dataset with a small number of human readable synthetic images. Selection of maximally informative synthetic images is done via graph community analysis of the representation space. We compare downstream classification models trained on our synthetic distillation data to models trained on real data and reach performances suitable for practical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Recently, the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) has shown the potential to generate high-quality images by converting Gaussian random noise into realistic images. In this paper, we apply the DPM to augment the deep ultraviolet fluorescence (DUV) image dataset with an aim to improve breast cancer classification for intraoperative margin assessment. For classification, we divide the whole surface DUV image into small patches and extract convolutional features for each patch by utilizing the pre-trained ResNet. Then, we feed them into an XGBoost classifier for patch-level decisions and then fuse them with a regional importance map computed by Grad-CAM++ for whole surface-level prediction. Our experimental results show that augmenting the training dataset with the DPM significantly improves breast cancer detection performance in DUV images, increasing accuracy from 93% to 97%, compared to using Affine transformations and ProGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2024</p></details> |

While Vision Transformer has shown superior performance over convolutional neural networks in image classification tasks, their effectiveness is often demonstrated on sufficiently large 2D datasets and they easily encounter overfitting issues on small medical image datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a Diffusion-based 3D Vision Transformer (Diff3Dformer), which utilizes the latent space of the Diffusion model to form the slice sequence for 3D analysis and incorporates clustering attention into ViT to aggregate repetitive information within 3D CT scans, thereby harnessing the power of the advanced transformer in 3D classification tasks on small datasets. Our method exhibits improved performance on two different scales of small datasets of 3D lung CT scans, surpassing the state of the art 3D methods and other transformer-based approaches that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its robust and superior performance across different scales of data. Experimental results underscore the superiority of our proposed method, indicating its potential for enhancing medical image classification tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | conference |

Methods: This paper proposes the Guided Conditional Diffusion Classifier (ConDiff), a novel deep-learning infection detection model that combines guided image synthesis with a denoising diffusion model and distance-based classification. The process involves (1) generating guided conditional synthetic images by injecting Gaussian noise to a guide image, followed by denoising the noise-perturbed image through a reverse diffusion process, conditioned on infection status and (2) classifying infections based on the minimum Euclidean distance between synthesized images and the original guide image in embedding space. Results: ConDiff demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 83% and an F1-score of 0.858, outperforming state-of-the-art models by at least 3%. The use of a triplet loss function reduces overfitting in the distance-based classifier. Conclusions: ConDiff not only enhances diagnostic accuracy for DFU infections but also pioneers the use of generative discriminative models for detailed medical image analysis, offering a promising approach for improving patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models facilitate high-fidelity medical image generation, reducing the costs associated with acquiring and annotating new images. This paper utilizes recent vision-language models to produce diverse and realistic synthetic echocardiography image data, preserving key features of the original images guided by textual and semantic label maps. Specifically, we investigate three potential avenues: unconditional generation, generation guided by text, and a hybrid approach incorporating both textual and semantic supervision. We show that the rich contextual information present in the synthesized data potentially enhances the accuracy and interpretability of downstream tasks, such as echocardiography segmentation and classification with improved metrics and faster convergence.

To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index, and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks using a large-cohort study, specifically, the UK Biobank. We assess our method by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of younger patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments.

| **[Iterative Online Image Synthesis via Diffusion Model for Imbalanced Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08407v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust classification of diseases is important for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, medical datasets often face challenges related to limited sample sizes and inherent imbalanced distributions, due to difficulties in data collection and variations in disease prevalence across different types. In this paper, we introduce an Iterative Online Image Synthesis (IOIS) framework to address the class imbalance problem in medical image classification. Our framework incorporates two key modules, namely Online Image Synthesis (OIS) and Accuracy Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which collectively target the imbalance classification issue at both the instance level and the class level. The OIS module alleviates the data insufficiency problem by generating representative samples tailored for online training of the classifier. On the other hand, the AAS module dynamically balances the synthesized samples among various classes, targeting those with low training accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method in addressing imbalanced classification, we conduct experiments on the HAM10000 and APTOS datasets. The results obtained demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods as well as the effectiveness of each component. The source code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (weather, location, etc.). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata, and its heterogeneity poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce Time Weaver, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that Time Weaver outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 27% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion of Diffusion Weighted MRI and Clinical Data for Predicting Functional Outcome after Acute Ischemic Stroke with Deep Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10894v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stroke is a common disabling neurological condition that affects about one-quarter of the adult population over age 25; more than half of patients still have poor outcomes, such as permanent functional dependence or even death, after the onset of acute stroke. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted MRI modalities combining with structured health profile on predicting the functional outcome to facilitate early intervention. A deep fusion learning network is proposed with two-stage training: the first stage focuses on cross-modality representation learning and the second stage on classification. Supervised contrastive learning is exploited to learn discriminative features that separate the two classes of patients from embeddings of individual modalities and from the fused multimodal embedding. The network takes as the input DWI and ADC images, and structured health profile data. The outcome is the prediction of the patient needing long-term care at 3 months after the onset of stroke. Trained and evaluated with a dataset of 3297 patients, our proposed fusion model achieves 0.87, 0.80 and 80.45% for AUC, F1-score and accuracy, respectively, outperforming existing models that consolidate both imaging and structured data in the medical domain. If trained with comprehensive clinical variables, including NIHSS and comorbidities, the gain from images on making accurate prediction is not considered substantial, but significant. However, diffusion-weighted MRI can replace NIHSS to achieve comparable level of accuracy combining with other readily available clinical variables for better generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a noncontact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used. The final classification maps obtained have been analyzed and validated by specialists. These preliminary results are promising, obtaining an accurate delineation of the tumor area.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing computer-aided skin cancer classification systems employ deep learning approaches. However, recent studies reveal their extreme vulnerability to adversarial attacks -- often imperceptible perturbations to significantly reduce the performances of skin cancer diagnosis models. To mitigate these threats, this work presents a simple, effective, and resource-efficient defense framework by reverse engineering adversarial perturbations in skin cancer images. Specifically, a multiscale image pyramid is first established to better preserve discriminative structures in the medical imaging domain. To neutralize adversarial effects, skin images at different scales are then progressively diffused by injecting isotropic Gaussian noises to move the adversarial examples to the clean image manifold. Crucially, to further reverse adversarial noises and suppress redundant injected noises, a novel multiscale denoising mechanism is carefully designed that aggregates image information from neighboring scales. We evaluated the defensive effectiveness of our method on ISIC 2019, a largest skin cancer multiclass classification dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully reverse adversarial perturbations from different attacks and significantly outperform some state-of-the-art methods in defending skin cancer diagnosis models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

However, traditional data gathering methods are too slow for these scenarios necessitating innovative approaches to generate reliable models quickly from minimal data. We demonstrate our new approach by building a comprehensive computer vision model for detecting Human Papilloma Virus Genital warts using only synthetic data. In our study, we employed a two phase experimental design using diffusion models. In the first phase diffusion models were utilized to generate a large number of diverse synthetic images from 10 HPV guide images explicitly focusing on accurately depicting genital warts. The second phase involved the training and testing vision model using this synthetic dataset. This method aimed to assess the effectiveness of diffusion models in rapidly generating high quality training data and the subsequent impact on the vision model performance in medical image recognition. The study findings revealed significant insights into the performance of the vision model trained on synthetic images generated through diffusion models. The vision model showed exceptional performance in accurately identifying cases of genital warts. It achieved an accuracy rate of 96% underscoring its effectiveness in medical image classification. For HPV cases the model demonstrated a high precision of 99% and a recall of 94%. In normal cases the precision was 95% with an impressive recall of 99%. These metrics indicate the model capability to correctly identify true positive cases and minimize false positives. The model achieved an F1 Score of 96% for HPV cases and 97% for normal cases. The high F1 Score across both categories highlights the balanced nature of the model precision and recall ensuring reliability and robustness in its predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages 5 figures 1 table</p></details> |

Open-source medical datasets, while valuable, suffer from data quality and clinical information disparities. Generative models, such as diffusion models, aim to mitigate these challenges. At Stanford, researchers explored the utility of a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model (RoentGen) for medical imaging data augmentation. Our work examines specific considerations to expand the Stanford research question, Could Stable Diffusion Solve a Gap in Medical Imaging Data? from the lens of bias and validity of the generated outcomes. We leveraged RoentGen to produce synthetic Chest-XRay (CXR) images and conducted assessments on bias, validity, and hallucinations. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by a disease classifier, while a COVID classifier uncovered latent hallucinations. The bias analysis unveiled disparities in classification performance among various subgroups, with a pronounced impact on the Female Hispanic subgroup. Furthermore, incorporating race and gender into input prompts exacerbated fairness issues in the generated images. The quality of synthetic images exhibited variability, particularly in certain disease classes, where there was more significant uncertainty compared to the original images. Additionally, we observed latent hallucinations, with approximately 42% of the images incorrectly indicating COVID, hinting at the presence of hallucinatory elements. These identifications provide new research directions towards interpretability of synthetic CXR images, for further understanding of associated risks and patient safety in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) - "Medical Imaging Meets NeurIPS" Workshop</p></details> |

However, the need for annotated medical images is often an obstacle to leveraging the full power of machine learning models. Our research demonstrates that by combining synthetic images, generated using diffusion models, with real images, we can enhance nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) classification performance even in low-data regime settings.

Our results show superior performance for the diffusion-generated images, with a maximum IS score of $1.90$ compared to $1.67$ for GANs, and a minimum FID score of $69.45$ compared to $100.05$ for GANs. Utilizing a partially frozen CNN backbone (EfficientNet v1), our synthetic augmentation method achieves a maximum image-level ROC AUC of $0.904$ on a NAFLD prediction task.</p></details> | 36 pages, 13 figures |

However, real DFU datasets are limited, hindering clinical training and research activities. In recent years, generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating synthetic images with remarkable realism and diversity in many applications. This paper explores the potential of diffusion models for synthesizing DFU images and evaluates their authenticity through expert clinician assessments. Additionally, evaluation metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) are examined to assess the quality of the synthetic DFU images. A dataset of 2,000 DFU images is used for training the diffusion model, and the synthetic images are generated by applying diffusion processes. The results indicate that the diffusion model successfully synthesizes visually indistinguishable DFU images. 70% of the time, clinicians marked synthetic DFU images as real DFUs. However, clinicians demonstrate higher unanimous confidence in rating real images than synthetic ones. The study also reveals that FID and KID metrics do not significantly align with clinicians' assessments, suggesting alternative evaluation approaches are needed. The findings highlight the potential of diffusion models for generating synthetic DFU images and their impact on medical training programs and research in wound detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 6th Workshop on AI for Aging, Rehabilitation and Intelligent Assisted Living at European Conference on Machine Learning, Italy, 2023</p></details> |

However, existing models struggle with complex relationships and characteristics of spectral-spatial data due to the multi-band nature and data redundancy of hyperspectral data. To address this limitation, we propose a new network called DiffSpectralNet, which combines diffusion and transformer techniques. Our approach involves a two-step process. First, we use an unsupervised learning framework based on the diffusion model to extract both high-level and low-level spectral-spatial features. The diffusion method is capable of extracting diverse and meaningful spectral-spatial features, leading to improvement in HSI classification. Then, we employ a pretrained denoising U-Net to extract intermediate hierarchical features for classification. Finally, we use a supervised transformer-based classifier to perform the HSI classification. Through comprehensive experiments on HSI datasets, we evaluate the classification performance of DiffSpectralNet. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We may therefore increase the interpretability of deep learning models by imbuing them with a similar style of reasoning. In this work, we apply this principle by classifying Alzheimer's Disease based on the similarity of images to training examples within the latent space. We use a contrastive loss combined with a diffusion autoencoder backbone, to produce a semantically meaningful latent space, such that neighbouring latents have similar image-level features. We achieve a classification accuracy comparable to black box approaches on a dataset of 2D MRI images, whilst producing human interpretable model explanations. Therefore, this work stands as a contribution to the pertinent development of accurate and interpretable deep learning within medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certification of Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03664v1)** | 2023-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, segmentation models have known a significant improvement in the past decade and are now used daily in clinical practice. However, similar to classification models, segmentation models are affected by adversarial attacks. In a safety-critical field like healthcare, certifying model predictions is of the utmost importance. Randomized smoothing has been introduced lately and provides a framework to certify models and obtain theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we present for the first time a certified segmentation baseline for medical imaging based on randomized smoothing and diffusion models. Our results show that leveraging the power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models helps us overcome the limits of randomized smoothing. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets of chest X-rays, skin lesions, and colonoscopies, and empirically show that we are able to maintain high certified Dice scores even for highly perturbed images. Our work represents the first attempt to certify medical image segmentation models, and we aspire for it to set a foundation for future benchmarks in this crucial and largely uncharted area.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIE: Simulating Disease Progression via Progressive Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11745v2)** | 2023-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disease progression simulation is a crucial area of research that has significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from 35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2% of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to model disease trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and checkpoints for replicating our results can be found at https://github.com/IrohXu/PIE and https://huggingface.co/IrohXu/stable-diffusion-mimic-cxr-v0.1</p></details> |

Among the significant developments in this field are the applications of generative AI models, specifically transformers and diffusion models. These models have played a crucial role in analyzing diverse forms of data, including medical imaging (encompassing image reconstruction, image-to-image translation, image generation, and image classification), protein structure prediction, clinical documentation, diagnostic assistance, radiology interpretation, clinical decision support, medical coding, and billing, as well as drug design and molecular representation. Such applications have enhanced clinical diagnosis, data reconstruction, and drug synthesis. This review paper aims to offer a thorough overview of the generative AI applications in healthcare, focusing on transformers and diffusion models. Additionally, we propose potential directions for future research to tackle the existing limitations and meet the evolving demands of the healthcare sector.

Current techniques for evaluating deep learning models cannot visualize confounding factors at a diagnostic level. Here, we propose a self-conditioned diffusion model termed DiffChest and train it on a dataset of 515,704 chest radiographs from 194,956 patients from multiple healthcare centers in the United States and Europe. DiffChest explains classifications on a patient-specific level and visualizes the confounding factors that may mislead the model. We found high inter-reader agreement when evaluating DiffChest's capability to identify treatment-related confounders, with Fleiss' Kappa values of 0.8 or higher across most imaging findings. Confounders were accurately captured with 11.1% to 100% prevalence rates. Furthermore, our pretraining process optimized the model to capture the most relevant information from the input radiographs. DiffChest achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy when diagnosing 11 chest conditions, such as pleural effusion and cardiac insufficiency, and at least sufficient diagnostic accuracy for the remaining conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of pretraining based on diffusion models in medical image classification, specifically in providing insights into confounding factors and model robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Structural and Functional Connectivities using Disentangled VAE for Detecting MCI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09629v2)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain network analysis is a useful approach to studying human brain disorders because it can distinguish patients from healthy people by detecting abnormal connections. Due to the complementary information from multiple modal neuroimages, multimodal fusion technology has a lot of potential for improving prediction performance. However, effective fusion of multimodal medical images to achieve complementarity is still a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel hierarchical structural-functional connectivity fusing (HSCF) model is proposed to construct brain structural-functional connectivity matrices and predict abnormal brain connections based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Specifically, the prior knowledge is incorporated into the separators for disentangling each modality of information by the graph convolutional networks (GCN). And a disentangled cosine distance loss is devised to ensure the disentanglement's effectiveness. Moreover, the hierarchical representation fusion module is designed to effectively maximize the combination of relevant and effective features between modalities, which makes the generated structural-functional connectivity more robust and discriminative in the cognitive disease analysis. Results from a wide range of tests performed on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database show that the proposed model performs better than competing approaches in terms of classification evaluation. In general, the proposed HSCF model is a promising model for generating brain structural-functional connectivities and identifying abnormal brain connections as cognitive disease progresses.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Synthetic Augmentation with Large-scale Unconditional Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04020v1)** | 2023-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based medical image recognition systems often require a substantial amount of training data with expert annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Recently, synthetic augmentation techniques have been proposed to mitigate the issue by generating realistic images conditioned on class labels. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the representation capability of the trained generative model, which cannot be guaranteed without sufficient labeled training data. To further reduce the dependency on annotated data, we propose a synthetic augmentation method called HistoDiffusion, which can be pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and later applied to a small-scale labeled dataset for augmented training. In particular, we train a latent diffusion model (LDM) on diverse unlabeled datasets to learn common features and generate realistic images without conditional inputs. Then, we fine-tune the model with classifier guidance in latent space on an unseen labeled dataset so that the model can synthesize images of specific categories. Additionally, we adopt a selective mechanism to only add synthetic samples with high confidence of matching to target labels. We evaluate our proposed method by pre-training on three histopathology datasets and testing on a histopathology dataset of colorectal cancer (CRC) excluded from the pre-training datasets. With HistoDiffusion augmentation, the classification accuracy of a backbone classifier is remarkably improved by 6.4% using a small set of the original labels. Our code is available at https://github.com/karenyyy/HistoDiffAug.</p></details> | MICCAI 2023 |
| **[Deep Learning Approaches for Data Augmentation in Medical Imaging: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13125v1)** | 2023-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has become a popular tool for medical image analysis, but the limited availability of training data remains a major challenge, particularly in the medical field where data acquisition can be costly and subject to privacy regulations. Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[FEDD -- Fair, Efficient, and Diverse Diffusion-based Lesion Segmentation and Malignancy Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11654v1)** | 2023-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skin diseases affect millions of people worldwide, across all ethnicities. Increasing diagnosis accessibility requires fair and accurate segmentation and classification of dermatology images. However, the scarcity of annotated medical images, especially for rare diseases and underrepresented skin tones, poses a challenge to the development of fair and accurate models. In this study, we introduce a Fair, Efficient, and Diverse Diffusion-based framework for skin lesion segmentation and malignancy classification. FEDD leverages semantically meaningful feature embeddings learned through a denoising diffusion probabilistic backbone and processes them via linear probes to achieve state-of-the-art performance on Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). We achieve an improvement in intersection over union of 0.18, 0.13, 0.06, and 0.07 while using only 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% labeled samples, respectively. Additionally, FEDD trained on 10% of DDI demonstrates malignancy classification accuracy of 81%, 14% higher compared to the state-of-the-art. We showcase high efficiency in data-constrained scenarios while providing fair performance for diverse skin tones and rare malignancy conditions. Our newly annotated DDI segmentation masks and training code can be found on https://github.com/hectorcarrion/fedd.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMIC: Dual-Guidance Diffusion Network for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10610v3)** | 2023-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models have recently shown remarkable performance in generative image modeling, attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. However, while a substantial amount of diffusion-based research has focused on generative tasks, few studies have applied diffusion models to general medical image classification. In this paper, we propose the first diffusion-based model (named DiffMIC) to address general medical image classification by eliminating unexpected noise and perturbations in medical images and robustly capturing semantic representation. To achieve this goal, we devise a dual conditional guidance strategy that conditions each diffusion step with multiple granularities to improve step-wise regional attention. Furthermore, we propose learning the mutual information in each granularity by enforcing Maximum-Mean Discrepancy regularization during the diffusion forward process. We evaluate the effectiveness of our DiffMIC on three medical classification tasks with different image modalities, including placental maturity grading on ultrasound images, skin lesion classification using dermatoscopic images, and diabetic retinopathy grading using fundus images. Our experimental results demonstrate that DiffMIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, indicating the universality and effectiveness of the proposed model. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/scott-yjyang/DiffMIC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Nuclei Representations with Masked Image Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17116v1)** | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked image modelling (MIM) is a powerful self-supervised representation learning paradigm, whose potential has not been widely demonstrated in medical image analysis. In this work, we show the capacity of MIM to capture rich semantic representations of Haemotoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained images at the nuclear level. Inspired by Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers (BEiT), we split the images into smaller patches and generate corresponding discrete visual tokens. In addition to the regular grid-based patches, typically used in visual Transformers, we introduce patches of individual cell nuclei. We propose positional encoding of the irregular distribution of these structures within an image. We pre-train the model in a self-supervised manner on H&E-stained whole-slide images of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where cell nuclei have been segmented. The pre-training objective is to recover the original discrete visual tokens of the masked image on the one hand, and to reconstruct the visual tokens of the masked object instances on the other. Coupling these two pre-training tasks allows us to build powerful, context-aware representations of nuclei. Our model generalizes well and can be fine-tuned on downstream classification tasks, achieving improved cell classification accuracy on PanNuke dataset by more than 5% compared to current instance segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

Due to ethical concerns, obtaining sufficient medical data for machine learning is a challenge, which our approach aims to address by synthesising more data. We utilised the Chest X-ray 14 dataset for our experiments and evaluated the performance of our models through qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our results show that the generated images are visually convincing and can be used to improve the accuracy of classification models. However, further work is needed to address issues such as overfitting and the limited availability of real data for training and testing. The potential of our approach to contribute to more effective medical diagnosis through deep learning is promising, and we believe that continued advancements in image generation technology will lead to even more promising results in the future.</p></details> |  |

It can be classified into several subtypes, including clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed and trained for classifying different subtypes of RCC using ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a dataset of RCC histopathology images, which consisted of digital images of RCC surgical resection slides that were annotated with the corresponding subtype labels. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, in this research, a novel synthetic image generation tool, NephroNet, is developed on diffusion models that are used to generate original images of RCC surgical resection slides. Diffusion models are a class of generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from noise. Several diffusers such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth Text-to-Image, and Textual Inversion were trained on a dataset of RCC images and were used to generate a series of original images that resembled RCC surgical resection slides, all within the span of fewer than four seconds. The generated images were visually realistic and could be used for creating new training datasets, testing the performance of image analysis algorithms, and training medical professionals. NephroNet is provided as an open-source software package and contains files for data preprocessing, training, and visualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence and diffusion models for classifying and generating RCC images, respectively. These methods could be useful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of RCC and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, labeled training data for real-world applications such as healthcare is limited and difficult to access given longstanding privacy, and strict data sharing policies. By manipulating image datasets in the pixel or feature space, existing data augmentation techniques represent one of the effective ways to improve the quantity and diversity of training data. Here, we look to advance augmentation techniques by building upon the emerging success of text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models in augmenting the training samples of our macroscopic skin disease dataset. We do so by enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process via input text prompts. We demonstrate that this generative data augmentation approach successfully maintains a similar classification accuracy of the visual classifier even when trained on a fully synthetic skin disease dataset. Similar to recent applications of generative models, our study suggests that diffusion models are indeed effective in generating high-quality skin images that do not sacrifice the classifier performance, and can improve the augmentation of training datasets after curation.</p></details> |  |

However, biometric identifiers in chest radiographs hinder the public sharing of such data for research purposes due to the risk of patient re-identification. To counteract this issue, synthetic data generation offers a solution for anonymizing medical images. This work employs a latent diffusion model to synthesize an anonymous chest X-ray dataset of high-quality class-conditional images. We propose a privacy-enhancing sampling strategy to ensure the non-transference of biometric information during the image generation process. The quality of the generated images and the feasibility of serving as exclusive training data are evaluated on a thoracic abnormality classification task. Compared to a real classifier, we achieve competitive results with a performance gap of only 3.5% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Automatic Identification of Claim Spans on Twitter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04710v2)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread diffusion of medical and political claims in the wake of COVID-19 has led to a voluminous rise in misinformation and fake news. The current vogue is to employ manual fact-checkers to efficiently classify and verify such data to combat this avalanche of claim-ridden misinformation. However, the rate of information dissemination is such that it vastly outpaces the fact-checkers' strength. Therefore, to aid manual fact-checkers in eliminating the superfluous content, it becomes imperative to automatically identify and extract the snippets of claim-worthy (mis)information present in a post. In this work, we introduce the novel task of Claim Span Identification (CSI). We propose CURT, a large-scale Twitter corpus with token-level claim spans on more than 7.5k tweets. Furthermore, along with the standard token classification baselines, we benchmark our dataset with DABERTa, an adapter-based variation of RoBERTa. The experimental results attest that DABERTa outperforms the baseline systems across several evaluation metrics, improving by about 1.5 points. We also report detailed error analysis to validate the model's performance along with the ablation studies. Lastly, we release our comprehensive span annotation guidelines for public use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP22. 16 pages including Appendix</p></details> |

Neuropathic Pain (NP) is a common sub-type which is often caused due to nerve damage and has a known pathophysiology. Another common sub-type is Fibromyalgia (FM) which is described as musculoskeletal, diffuse pain that is widespread through the body. The pathophysiology of FM is poorly understood, making it very hard to diagnose. Standard medications and treatments for FM and NP differ from one another and if misdiagnosed it can cause an increase in symptom severity. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel framework, PainPoints, which accurately detects the sub-type of pain and generates clinical notes via summarizing the patient interviews. Specifically, PainPoints makes use of large language models to perform sentence-level classification of the text obtained from interviews of FM and NP patients with a reliable AUC of 0.83. Using a sufficiency-based interpretability approach, we explain how the fine-tuned model accurately picks up on the nuances that patients use to describe their pain. Finally, we generate summaries of these interviews via expert interventions by introducing a novel facet-based approach. PainPoints thus enables practitioners to add/drop facets and generate a custom summary based on the notion of "facet-coverage" which is also introduced in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prostate Lesion Detection and Salient Feature Assessment Using Zone-Based Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11522v1)** | 2022-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has a growing role in detecting prostate cancer lesions. Thus, it is pertinent that medical professionals who interpret these scans reduce the risk of human error by using computer-aided detection systems. The variety of algorithms used in system implementation, however, has yielded mixed results. Here we investigate the best machine learning classifier for each prostate zone. We also discover salient features to clarify the models' classification rationale. Of the data provided, we gathered and augmented T2 weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient map images to extract first through third order statistical features as input to machine learning classifiers. For our deep learning classifier, we used a convolutional neural net (CNN) architecture for automatic feature extraction and classification. The interpretability of the CNN results was improved by saliency mapping to understand the classification mechanisms within. Ultimately, we concluded that effective detection of peripheral and anterior fibromuscular stroma (AS) lesions depended more on statistical distribution features, whereas those in the transition zone (TZ) depended more on textural features. Ensemble algorithms worked best for PZ and TZ zones, while CNNs were best in the AS zone. These classifiers can be used to validate a radiologist's predictions and reduce inter-reader variability in patients suspected to have prostate cancer. The salient features reported in this study can also be investigated further to better understand hidden features and biomarkers of prostate lesions with mpMRIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Fully Distributed Federated Learning with Adaptive Local Links](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12281v1)** | 2022-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, data-driven, machine and deep learning approaches have provided unprecedented performance in various complex tasks, including image classification and object detection, and in a variety of application areas, like autonomous vehicles, medical imaging and wireless communications. Traditionally, such approaches have been deployed, along with the involved datasets, on standalone devices. Recently, a shift has been observed towards the so-called Edge Machine Learning, in which centralized architectures are adopted that allow multiple devices with local computational and storage resources to collaborate with the assistance of a centralized server. The well-known federated learning approach is able to utilize such architectures by allowing the exchange of only parameters with the server, while keeping the datasets private to each contributing device. In this work, we propose a fully distributed, diffusion-based learning algorithm that does not require a central server and propose an adaptive combination rule for the cooperation of the devices. By adopting a classification task on the MNIST dataset, the efficacy of the proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts is demonstrated via the reduction of the number of collaboration rounds required to achieve an acceptable accuracy level in non- IID dataset scenarios.</p></details> |  |

It promotes the feature extraction (by representation learning) as the core of image retrieval, with the relevance/matching evaluation being degenerated into simple similarity metrics. In many applications, we need the matching evidence to be indicated rather than just have the ranked list (e.g., the locations of the target proteins/cells/lesions in medical images). It is like the matched words need to be highlighted in search engines. However, this is not easy to implement without explicit relevance/matching modeling. The deep representation learning models are not feasible because of their blackbox nature. In this paper, we revisit the importance of relevance/matching modeling in deep learning era with an indicative retrieval setting. The study shows that it is possible to skip the representation learning and model the matching evidence directly. By removing the dependency on the pre-trained models, it has avoided a lot of related issues (e.g., the domain gap between classification and retrieval, the detail-diffusion caused by convolution, and so on). More importantly, the study demonstrates that the matching can be explicitly modeled and backtracked later for generating the matching evidence indications. It can improve the explainability of deep inference. Our method obtains a best performance in literature on both Oxford-5k and Paris-6k, and sets a new record of 97.77% on Oxford-5k (97.81% on Paris-6k) without extracting any deep features.</p></details> |  |

The current PCa diagnostic pathway comes at the cost of substantial overdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatment and further testing. Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) based on apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) sequences has been proposed as a triage test to differentiate between clinically significant (cS) and non-clinically significant (ncS) prostate lesions. However, analysis of the sequences relies on expertise, requires specialized training, and suffers from inter-observer variability. Deep learning (DL) techniques hold promise in tasks such as classification and detection. Nevertheless, they rely on large amounts of annotated data which is not common in the medical field. In order to palliate such issues, existing works rely on transfer learning (TL) and ImageNet pre-training, which has been proven to be sub-optimal for the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we present a patch-based pre-training strategy to distinguish between cS and ncS lesions which exploit the region of interest (ROI) of the patched source domain to efficiently train a classifier in the full-slice target domain which does not require annotations by making use of transfer learning (TL). We provide a comprehensive comparison between several CNNs architectures and different settings which are presented as a baseline. Moreover, we explore cross-domain TL which exploits both MRI modalities and improves single modality results. Finally, we show how our approaches outperform the standard approaches by a considerable margin</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages. Article under review</p></details> |

Accurately detecting and segmenting lymphomas from these two imaging modalities are critical tasks for cancer staging and radiotherapy planning. However, this task is still challenging due to the complexity of PET/CT images, and the computation cost to process 3D data. In this paper, a segmentation method based on belief functions is proposed to segment lymphomas in 3D PET/CT images. The architecture is composed of a feature extraction module and an evidential segmentation (ES) module. The ES module outputs not only segmentation results (binary maps indicating the presence or absence of lymphoma in each voxel) but also uncertainty maps quantifying the classification uncertainty. The whole model is optimized by minimizing Dice and uncertainty loss functions to increase segmentation accuracy. The method was evaluated on a database of 173 patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Belief2021 |

Neural networks can work with full-size data without extensive preprocessing and feature generation and, thus, information loss. Recent work has shown that the morphological difference in specific brain regions can be found on MRI with the means of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). However, interpretation of the existing models is based on a region of interest and can not be extended to voxel-wise image interpretation on a whole image. In the current work, we consider the classification task on a large-scale open-source dataset of young healthy subjects -- an exploration of brain differences between men and women. In this paper, we extend the previous findings in gender differences from diffusion-tensor imaging on T1 brain MRI scans. We provide the voxel-wise 3D CNN interpretation comparing the results of three interpretation methods: Meaningful Perturbations, Grad CAM and Guided Backpropagation, and contribute with the open-source library.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Based on a data-driven relationship between input image and pathological classification, these predictors deliver unprecedented accuracy. Yet, the numerous approaches trying to explain the causality of this learned relationship have fallen short: time constraints, coarse, diffuse and at times misleading results, caused by the employment of heuristic techniques like Gaussian noise and blurring, have hindered their clinical adoption. In this work, we discuss and overcome these obstacles by introducing a neural-network based attribution method, applicable to any trained predictor. Our solution identifies salient regions of an input image in a single forward-pass by measuring the effect of local image-perturbations on a predictor's score. We replace heuristic techniques with a strong neighborhood conditioned inpainting approach, avoiding anatomically implausible, hence adversarial artifacts. We evaluate on public mammography data and compare against existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we exemplify the approach's generalizability by demonstrating results on chest X-rays. Our solution shows, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a significant reduction of localization ambiguity and clearer conveying results, without sacrificing time efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2020.This version differs from the published conference version only in a funding agencies name, and additional clarifying changes and references in figure 3</p></details> |

Artificial neural networks while achieving class-leading scores fall short in this regard. Therefore, numerous approaches have been proposed that map a salient region of an image to a diagnostic classification. Utilizing heuristic methodology, like blurring and noise, they tend to produce diffuse, sometimes misleading results, hindering their general adoption. In this work we overcome these issues by presenting a model agnostic saliency mapping framework tailored to medical imaging. We replace heuristic techniques with a strong neighborhood conditioned inpainting approach, which avoids anatomically implausible artefacts. We formulate saliency attribution as a map-quality optimization task, enforcing constrained and focused attributions. Experiments on public mammography data show quantitatively and qualitatively more precise localization and clearer conveying results than existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020</p></details> |

The objective of this research was to obtain a model for apricot mass and separate apricot variety with image processing technology using external features of apricot fruit. In this study, five verities of apricot were used. In order to determine the size of the fruits, three mutually perpendicular axes were defined, length, width, and thickness. Measurements show that the effect of variety on all properties was statistically significant at the 1% probability level. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between the estimated dimensions by image processing approach and the actual dimensions. The developed system consists of a digital camera, a light diffusion chamber, a distance adjustment pedestal, and a personal computer. Images taken by the digital camera were stored as (RGB) for further analysis. The images were taken for a number of 49 samples of each cultivar in three directions. A linear equation is recommended to calculate the apricot mass based on the length and the width with R 2 = 0.97. In addition, ANFIS model with C-means was the best model for classifying the apricot varieties based on the physical features including length, width, thickness, mass, and projected area of three perpendicular surfaces. The accuracy of the model was 87.7.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, most generative architectures struggle to capture the underlying probability distributions of volumetric data, exhibit convergence problems, and offer no robust indices of model uncertainty. By comparison, the autoregressive generative model PixelCNN can be extended to volumetric data with relative ease, it readily attempts to learn the true underlying probability distribution and it still admits a Bayesian reformulation that provides a principled framework for reasoning about model uncertainty. Our contributions in this paper are two fold: first, we extend PixelCNN to work with volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging data. Second, we show that reformulating this model to approximate a deep Gaussian process yields a measure of uncertainty that improves the performance of semi-supervised learning, in particular classification performance in settings where the proportion of labelled data is low. We quantify this improvement across classification, regression, and semantic segmentation tasks, training and testing on clinical magnetic resonance brain imaging data comprising T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted sequences.</p></details> |  |

CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives--such as attributes and objects--that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose a Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stepwise Decomposition and Dual-stream Focus: A Novel Approach for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06818v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

| **[No time to train! Training-Free Reference-Based Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02798v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Prompt Disentanglement via Language Guidance and Representation Alignment for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02288v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM) and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Selective Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (SCING) that enhances cross-modal alignment and robustness against real-world perturbations. Our method introduces two key innovations: Firstly, we proposed Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP), a lightweight module that dynamically injects discriminative visual features into text prompts via a cross-modal gating mechanism. Moreover, the proposed Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) is a dual-path training strategy that enforces invariant feature alignment under random image perturbations by regularizing consistency between original and augmented cross-modal embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular benchmarks covering Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, Occluded-Duke, Occluded-REID, and P-DukeMTMC, which demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed method. Notably, our framework eliminates heavy adapters while maintaining efficient inference, achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</p></details> |  |

We propose a simple yet effective Region Conditioned Adaptation, a hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that equips the frozen CLIP with the ability to infer explanations from local visual cues. We encode "local hints" and "global contexts" into visual prompts of the CLIP model separately at fine and coarse-grained levels. Adapters are used for fine-tuning CLIP models for downstream tasks and we design a new attention adapter, that directly steers the focus of the attention map with trainable query and key projections of a frozen CLIP model. Finally, we train our new model with a modified contrastive loss to regress the visual feature simultaneously toward features of literal description and plausible explanations. The loss enables CLIP to maintain both perception and reasoning abilities. Experiments on the Sherlock visual abductive reasoning benchmark show that the RCA significantly outstands previous SOTAs, ranking the 1st on the leaderboards (e.g., Human Acc: RCA 31.74 $\textit{vs}$ CPT-CLIP 29.58, higher =better). We also validate the RCA is generalizable to local perception benchmarks like RefCOCO.

| **[Attention to Burstiness: Low-Rank Bilinear Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22908v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Prompt-based methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models, providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://sais-fuxi.github.io/Omni-Video/</p></details> |

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency. All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B.

| **[Fine-Grained Knowledge Structuring and Retrieval for Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20964v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Question Answering (VQA) focuses on providing answers to natural language questions by utilizing information from images. Although cutting-edge multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o achieve strong performance on VQA tasks, they frequently fall short in accessing domain-specific or the latest knowledge. To mitigate this issue, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) leveraging external knowledge bases (KBs), referred to as KB-VQA, emerges as a promising approach. Nevertheless, conventional unimodal retrieval techniques, which translate images into textual descriptions, often result in the loss of critical visual details. To address these challenges, this study presents two key innovations. First, we introduce fine-grained knowledge units that consist of multimodal data fragments (e.g. text fragments, entity images, and so on) in a structured manner. Rather than merely refining retrieval mechanisms, we prioritize the systematic organization and management of these knowledge units, ensuring that the structuring process itself enhances retrieval quality. Second, we propose a knowledge unit retrieval-augmented generation framework (KU-RAG) that seamlessly integrates fine-grained retrieval with MLLMs. Our KU-RAG framework not only ensures precise retrieval of relevant knowledge but also enhances reasoning capabilities through a knowledge correction chain. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing KB-VQA methods across four benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of approximately 3% and up to 11% in the best case.</p></details> |  |

Existing codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a 500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics. This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis.

Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations.

This pioneering work reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR), achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks, including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse.

| **[FUDOKI: Discrete Flow-based Unified Understanding and Generation via Kinetic-Optimal Velocities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20147v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 12 figures |

This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |

These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,6 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

However, systematic legal standards and reliable evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.</p></details> |  |

Although existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Ital-IA 2025</p></details> |

However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Videos often have a larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones. Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Robust Hyper-Detailed Image Captioning: A Multiagent Approach and Dual Evaluation Metrics for Factuality and Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15484v4)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating highly detailed captions but often produce hallucinations. Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/adobe-research/CapMAS.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[VectorLLM: Human-like Extraction of Structured Building Contours vis Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04664v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement, which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks, highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting community development.</p></details> |  |

We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data, AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Advanced methods predominantly focus on language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality. Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition, and emotion tasks.

These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Even layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test.

Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed. The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Paper collection: https://github.com/LiQiiiii/DLLM-Survey</p></details> |  |

Motivated by cognitive science literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake, significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning abilities in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunfeixie233.github.io/ViGaL/</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks for evaluating hallucinations are generally static, which may overlook the potential risk of data contamination. To address this issue, we propose ODE, an open-set, dynamic protocol designed to evaluate object hallucinations in MLLMs at both the existence and attribute levels. ODE employs a graph-based structure to represent real-world object concepts, their attributes, and the distributional associations between them. This structure facilitates the extraction of concept combinations based on diverse distributional criteria, generating varied samples for structured queries that evaluate hallucinations in both generative and discriminative tasks. Through the generation of new samples, dynamic concept combinations, and varied distribution frequencies, ODE mitigates the risk of data contamination and broadens the scope of evaluation. This protocol is applicable to both general and specialized scenarios, including those with limited data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol, revealing that MLLMs exhibit higher hallucination rates when evaluated with ODE-generated samples, which indicates potential data contamination. Furthermore, these generated samples aid in analyzing hallucination patterns and fine-tuning models, offering an effective approach to mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which only adds six spatial visual tokens to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1) We propose a novel Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches: "from central region to global" and "from abstract to specific". Then, a cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information, enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants: LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA, achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple tasks with nearly identical inference latency.

| **[Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03262v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance, confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.</p></details> | Wrok in Process |

However, while effective for tasks governed by straightforward logic, MLLMs often struggle with reasoning complex, detail-intensive logical structures. To address this limitation, we introduce AgentPS, a novel framework that integrates Agentic Process Supervision into MLLMs by sequentially reasoning over ancillary questions during fine-tuning. AgentPS achieves substantial improvements over baseline MLLMs on both public benchmarks and proprietary datasets. Notably, we show that using MLLM-generated ancillary labels in place of human annotations yields only minimal performance degradation, highlighting the method's scalability. These results establish AgentPS as a scalable and effective solution for complex multimodal classification in large-scale industrial applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, without using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs, i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps. To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e., bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables, receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[Visual Contextual Attack: Jailbreaking MLLMs with Image-Driven Context Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02844v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs. However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs. Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The code is available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Visco-Attack.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with Diverse Solving Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02804v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, their performance is still lacking in physical domains that require understanding diagrams with complex physical structures and quantitative analysis based on multi-modal information. To address this, we develop a new framework, named Multi-Modal Scientific Reasoning with Physics Perception and Simulation (MAPS) based on an MLLM. MAPS decomposes expert-level multi-modal reasoning task into physical diagram understanding via a Physical Perception Model (PPM) and reasoning with physical knowledge via a simulator. The PPM module is obtained by fine-tuning a visual language model using carefully designed synthetic data with paired physical diagrams and corresponding simulation language descriptions. At the inference stage, MAPS integrates the simulation language description of the input diagram provided by PPM and results obtained through a Chain-of-Simulation process with MLLM to derive the underlying rationale and the final answer. Validated using our collected college-level circuit analysis problems, MAPS significantly improves reasoning accuracy of MLLM and outperforms all existing models. The results confirm MAPS offers a promising direction for enhancing multi-modal scientific reasoning ability of MLLMs. We will release our code, model and dataset used for our experiments upon publishing of this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRAgent-R1: Boosting Video Recommendation with MLLM-based Agents via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02626v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to powerful natural language processing and generative capabilities, large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing recommendation systems via user simulation. However, in the realm of video recommendation, existing studies predominantly resort to prompt-based simulation using frozen LLMs and encounter the intricate challenge of multimodal content understanding. This frequently results in suboptimal item modeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce VRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like intelligence in user simulation. Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two distinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US) Agent, designed for interactive user-item modeling. Firstly, the IP Agent emulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing hidden recommendation semantics in videos. With a more comprehensive multimodal content understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system is equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items. Subsequently, the US Agent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences through reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale video recommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed VRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\% improvement in NDCG@10 on the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\% higher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/nlp-waseda/traveling-across-languages</p></details> |
| **[Skip-Vision: Efficient and Scalable Acceleration of Vision-Language Models via Adaptive Token Skipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21817v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have driven significant advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically when scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[LLaVA-KD: A Framework of Distilling Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16236v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inspired the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for unified understanding of vision and language. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of large-scale MLLMs (l-MLLMs) limit their use in resource-constrained scenarios. Although small-scale MLLMs (s-MLLMs) are designed to reduce computational costs, they typically suffer from performance degradation. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLMs to s-MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to transfer teacher model's robust representations across both visual and linguistic modalities, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer teacher model's ability to capture visual token relationships. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of the proposed distillation strategy: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to strengthen the alignment between visual-linguistic representations in s-MLLMs, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the s-MLLMs with multimodal understanding capacity, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to refine s-MLLM's knowledge. Our approach significantly improves s-MLLMs performance without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

| **[Cautious Next Token Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03038v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2025 |

Traditional sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches (e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However, effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our o...</summary><p>Our original goal was to use Commander-GPT: Dividing and Routing for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (arXiv:2506.19420) to replace Commander-GPT: Fully Unleashing the Sarcasm Detection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (arXiv:2503.18681).

To address this limitation, we propose LaCo (Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations, and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while maintaining strong performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement, overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal. Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.</p></details> |  |

In practice, we face the difficulty of huge requirements for GPU resource if we need to deploy MLLMs online. In this paper, we propose COEF-VQ, a novel cascaded MLLM framework designed to enhance video quality understanding on the short-video platform while optimizing computational efficiency. Our approach integrates an entropy-based pre-filtering stage, where a lightweight model assesses uncertainty and selectively filters cases before passing them to the more computationally intensive MLLM for final evaluation. By prioritizing high-uncertainty samples for deeper analysis, our framework significantly reduces GPU usage while maintaining the strong classification performance of a full MLLM deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COEF-VQ, we deploy this new framework onto the video management platform (VMP) at the short-video platform, and perform a series of detailed experiments on two in-house tasks related to video quality understanding. We show that COEF-VQ leads to substantial performance gains from the offline evaluation in these two tasks and effectively enhances platform safety with limit resource consumption, significantly reducing inappropriate content video view rate by 9.9% in a online A/B test without affecting engagement. Post-launch monitoring confirmed sustained improvements, validating its real-world impact.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel video-based visual-spatial intelligence benchmark (VSI-Bench) of over 5,000 question-answer pairs, and find that MLLMs exhibit competitive - though subhuman - visual-spatial intelligence. We probe models to express how they think in space both linguistically and visually and find that while spatial reasoning capabilities remain the primary bottleneck for MLLMs to reach higher benchmark performance, local world models and spatial awareness do emerge within these models. Notably, prevailing linguistic reasoning techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree-of-thoughts) fail to improve performance, whereas explicitly generating cognitive maps during question-answering enhances MLLMs' spatial distance ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vision-x-nyu.github.io/thinking-in-space.github.io/</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an 8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment, followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report: https://github.com/Kwai-Keye/Keye</p></details> |

However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks.

Previous dexterous teleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand postures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent dexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their structural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we propose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables dexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion patterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the teleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to complete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible dexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures used in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM (Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to identify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and operator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and imitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types significantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform diverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://isee-laboratory.github.io/TypeTele</p></details> |

However, they often excessively rely on textual information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning. Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when, where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this, GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-GenIB to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling, maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for next-generation intelligent communications.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this, we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples, thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness. Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained analyses of model-specific weaknesses.

A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks. SAILViT series models are released at https://huggingface.co/BytedanceDouyinContent.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release SAILViT, a series of versatile vision foundation models</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose SimVec, a novel simplified vector format that encodes chart elements such as mark type, position, and size. The effectiveness of SimVec is demonstrated by using MLLMs to reconstruct chart information from SimVec formats. Then, we build a new visualization dataset, SimVecVis, to enhance the performance of MLLMs in visualization understanding, which consists of three key dimensions: bitmap images of charts, their SimVec representations, and corresponding data-centric question-answering (QA) pairs with explanatory chain-of-thought (CoT) descriptions. We finetune state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., MiniCPM and Qwen-VL), using SimVecVis with different dataset dimensions. The experimental results show that it leads to substantial performance improvements of MLLMs with good spatial perception capabilities (e.g., MiniCPM) in data-centric QA tasks. Our dataset and source code are available at: https://github.com/VIDA-Lab/SimVecVis.</p></details> |  |

However, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods, including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs' built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating jailbreak risks without compromising utility.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment. Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment. Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the VDCSCORE evaluation metric.</p></details> |  |

These models often fail to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability.

However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMLU-Reason, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMLU-Reason comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMLU-Reason offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 28 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection.

These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.</p></details> |  |

We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence. Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods, achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5, InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance degrades when handling real-world applications involving complex multi-image compositions and multimodal instructions, which reveals limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the reasoning performance of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving +9.04\% improvements on MIG-Bench and +4.98\% improvements on several out-of-domain reasoning grounding benchmarks over the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1\% and +2.4\% over the base model on subsets of the BLINK and MMIU benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, as task diversity and complexity increase, EVIT faces significant challenges in resolving data conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose the Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (Dual-LoRA), a holistic-to-local framework that enhances the adapter's capacity to address data conflict through dual structural optimization. Specifically, we utilize two subspaces: a skill space for stable, holistic knowledge retention, and a rank-rectified task space that locally activates the holistic knowledge. Additionally, we introduce Visual Cue Enhancement (VCE), a multi-level local feature aggregation module designed to enrich the vision-language projection with local details. Our approach is both memory- and time-efficient, requiring only 1.16$\times$ the inference time of the standard LoRA method (with injection into the query and value projection layers), and just 73\% of the inference time of a 4-expert LoRA-MoE. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and general MLLM benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Building on this, continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) extends the capability of MLLMs to incrementally learn new tasks, accommodating evolving functionalities. While prior work has advanced CVIT through the development of new benchmarks and approaches to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, these efforts largely follow traditional continual learning paradigms, neglecting the unique challenges specific to CVIT. We identify a dual form of catastrophic forgetting in CVIT, where MLLMs not only forget previously learned visual understanding but also experience a decline in instruction following abilities as they acquire new tasks. To address this, we introduce the Separable Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (SMoLoRA) framework, which employs separable routing through two distinct modules-one for visual understanding and another for instruction following. This dual-routing design enables specialized adaptation in both domains, preventing forgetting while improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a new CVIT benchmark that goes beyond existing benchmarks by additionally evaluating a model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks and handle diverse instructions across various tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMoLoRA outperforms existing methods in mitigating dual forgetting, improving generalization to unseen tasks, and ensuring robustness in following diverse instructions.

Current methodologies primarily focus on synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning \textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales. Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy.

This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy, which leverages both local functional attribution and global information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility. This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

The tasks of knowledge retrieval and answer generation tasks both necessitate precise multimodal understanding of question context and external knowledge. However, existing methods treat these two stages as separate modules with limited interaction during training, which hinders bi-directional parametric knowledge sharing, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance. To fully exploit the cross-task synergy in KB-VQA, we propose a unified retrieval-augmented VQA framework with collaborative parametric knowledge calibration. The proposed framework can effectively adapt general multimodal pre-trained models for fine-grained, knowledge-intensive tasks while enabling the retriever and generator to collaboratively enhance and share their parametric knowledge during both training and inference. To enhance fine-grained understanding of questions and external documents, we also integrate late interaction mechanism into the proposed training framework. Additionally, we introduce a reflective-answering mechanism that allows the model to explicitly evaluate and refine its knowledge boundary.

However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which automate many tasks, struggle to stay current, limited by the cutoff dates in their fixed training datasets. To quantify this stagnation, we introduce LiveVQA, the first-of-its-kind dataset featuring 107,143 samples and 12 categories data specifically designed to support research in both seeking and updating with live visual knowledge. Drawing from recent news articles, video platforms, and academic publications in April 2024-May 2025, LiveVQA enables evaluation of how models handle latest visual information beyond their knowledge boundaries and how current methods help to update them. Our comprehensive benchmarking of 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant performance gaps on content beyond knowledge cutoff, and tool-use or agentic visual seeking framework drastically gain an average of 327% improvement. Furthermore, we explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to update MLLMs with new visual knowledge. We dive deeply to the critical balance between adapter capacity and model capability when updating MLLMs with new visual knowledge. All the experimental dataset and source code are publicly available at: https://livevqa.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under Review</p></details> |

This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem, as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally, the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with pretrained embeddings.</p></details> |  |

Most existing caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities. Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level, detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage. The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality, we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Datasets and Models: https://github.com/lxtGH/DenseWorld-1M</p></details> |

Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles.

| **[Task Preference Optimization: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Vision Task Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19326v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with fine-grained or precise understanding of visuals although they give comprehensive perception and reasoning in a spectrum of vision applications. Recent studies either develop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive framework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address this issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we propose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes differentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks. TPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM. By leveraging rich visual labels during training, TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance. Through multi-task co-training within TPO, we observe synergistic benefits that elevate individual task performance beyond what is achievable through single-task training methodologies. Our instantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall 14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models. The code will be released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/TPO</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold reduction in visual tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |
| **[VAP-Diffusion: Enriching Descriptions with MLLMs for Enhanced Medical Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23641v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis, such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic, colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover, to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Multimodal Understanding via Byte-Pair Visual Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23639v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable and efficient multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PGOV3D: Open-Vocabulary 3D Semantic Segmentation with Partial-to-Global Curriculum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23607v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise 3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint, offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3) inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended, challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/MMReason.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[OrderChain: Towards General Instruct-Tuning for Stimulating the Ordinal Understanding Ability of MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04801v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5% to 93.2% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0% to 85.7% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing vision-language models to novel domains: A comprehensive survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18504v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities, resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of current and future multimodal researches.</p></details> |  |

While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (Preprint.

However, these advancements also raise critical concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other security threats. Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view imagery. Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to $49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues from visual data. Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text, architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate associated risks.

| **[Sample then Identify: A General Framework for Risk Control and Assessment in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08174v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025 Spotlights</p></details> |
| **[Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23270v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively, where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods, showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color, shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc).

Current methods often focus on specific data types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks. Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

However, existing methods primarily focus on global features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size, diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability.

However, growing concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias, particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle, interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for future bias mitigation.</p></details> |  |

Existing works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://danielshkao.github.io/thinkvideo.html</p></details> |
